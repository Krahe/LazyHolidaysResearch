Just a heads up - I'm happy to explain concepts, work through problems together, and help you understand the material, but I'll make sure you're actually learning rather than just giving you answers to copy. What are you working on?",0,1635,1635,2465,28.43,"This is a good linear algebra problem! Let me work through it step by step to help the student understand.

The matrix A is:
A = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  1 |
    | 0  0  3 |

This is an upper triangular matrix, which makes finding eigenvalues easier.

(a) Finding eigenvalues:
For eigenvalues, we need det(A - lambdaI) = 0

A - lambdaI = | 2-lambda   1    0  |
         | 0    2-lambda   1  |
         | 0     0   3-lambda |

Since this is upper triangular, det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda)

So eigenvalues are:
- lambda = 2 with alge","Great! This is a nice linear algebra problem. Let me walk you through it step-by-step so you understand the concepts.

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**Key observation**: A is upper triangular! This makes life easier.

For eigenvalues, we solve det(A - lambdaI) = 0

Since A is triangular, the determinant is just the product of diagonal entries:

det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = 0

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces

**For lambda = 2:**
Solve (A - 2I)v = 0:

```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```

This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, and v_1 is free

**Eigenspace for lambda = 2:** span{(1, 0, 0)^T}  
-> Geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:**
Solve (A - 3I)v = 0:

```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From the equations: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**Eigenspace for lambda = 3:** span{(1, 1, 1)^T}  
-> Geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**No!** Here's why:
- For diagonalizability, we need: geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for each eigenvalue
- For lambda = 2: algebraic mult. = 2, but geometric mult. = 1  
- We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for a 3*3 matrix

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**What does non-diagonalizable mean geometrically?**

A diagonalizable matrix can be completely understood as stretching along independent eigendirections. A non-diagonalizable matrix has a ""defect""-it doesn't have enough eigenvectors to span the space. This means there are **shearing** effects in addition to stretching.

Think of it like: some directions get stretched (eigenspaces), but because we're missing eigenvectors, the transformation also ""drags"" nearby vectors along with it in certain directions.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

*If A were diagonalizable:* A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (super easy!)

*Since A is NOT diagonalizable:* We need the **Jordan normal form**  
A = PJP^-^1 where J is almost diagonal but has some 1's on the superdiagonal

The Jordan form for this A would be:
```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1, but computing J^1^0^0 is trickier-those 1's cause polynomial terms to appear.

**The challenge:** Jordan blocks raise to powers using binomial-like formulas, creating terms like n*2 ^-^1 rather than just 2 .
