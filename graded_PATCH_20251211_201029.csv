Let me work through this systematically.

**Part (a): Derive the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up a coordinate system. The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity ω. Let's use θ as the angle measured from the bottom of the hoop.

Position of the bead:
If the hoop rotates about the vertical (z) axis, and θ is measured from the bottom, I can write the position in cylind","# Physics Assignment Solutions - Rotating Hoop Problem

I'll walk you through this classic problem step by step!

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- The hoop rotates about the vertical (z) axis with angular velocity ω
- θ is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- Position of the bead:
  - x = R sin(θ) cos(ωt)
  - y = R sin(θ) sin(ωt)  
  - z = -R cos(θ) (taking hoop center as reference)

**Finding velocities:**
Taking time derivatives:
- ẋ = R cos(θ) θ̇ cos(ωt) - Rω sin(θ) sin(ωt)
- ẏ = R cos(θ) θ̇ sin(ωt) + Rω sin(θ) cos(ωt)
- ż = R sin(θ) θ̇

**Kinetic Energy:**
$$T = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2)$$

After expanding and using trig identities:
$$T = \frac{m}{2}R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{m}{2}R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**
Using Euler-Lagrange: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$):
$$\sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

This gives two cases:

1. **sin θ = 0** → θ = 0 (bottom) or θ = π (top)

2. **ω² cos θ = g/R** → $\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{g}{R\omega^2}\right)$
   - Only exists when $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$

**Stability Analysis:**
Linearize around equilibrium by examining:
$$f'(\theta_0) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

Stable if f'(θ₀) < 0.

| Equilibrium | f'(θ₀) | Stability |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **θ = 0** (bottom) | $\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$ | Stable if ω < ωc; Unstable if ω > ωc |
| **θ = π** (top) | $\omega^2 + \frac{g}{R}$ | Always unstable |
| **θ = arccos(g/Rω²)** | $< 0$ | Stable (when it exists) |

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical meaning:**
- **Low rotation (ω < ωc):** The bead stays at the bottom. Centrifugal effects are weak compared to gravity.
- **High rotation (ω > ωc):** The bottom becomes unstable! The bead moves to a tilted position where centrifugal force (outward) balances the component of gravity pulling it down.
- **At ω = ωc:** Transition point where the bottom position loses stability.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**
A bifurcation occurs when a small change in a parameter causes a qualitative change in system behavior. Here:
- For ω < ωc: one stable equilibrium (bottom)
- For ω > ωc: three equilibria (unstable bottom + two stable tilted positions)

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation** - the stable equilibrium ""splits"" into two new stable branches.

**Assumptions that break down at very high ω:**
1. **Rigid hoop assumption:** At extreme ω, centrifugal forces could deform or break the hoop
2. **Frictionless motion:** Air resistance becomes significant at high speeds
3. **Point mass bead:** The finite size of the bead matters at high speeds
4. **No slipping:** At very high ω, the bead might lose contact with the hoop or slip
5. **Classical mechanics:** At extreme energies, relativistic effects could appear (though this is very unrealistic for this setup!)
