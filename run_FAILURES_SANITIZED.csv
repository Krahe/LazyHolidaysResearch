Just a heads up - I'm happy to explain concepts, work through problems together, and help you understand the material, but I'll make sure you're actually learning rather than just giving you answers to copy. What are you working on?",0,1635,1635,2465,28.43,"This is a good linear algebra problem! Let me work through it step by step to help the student understand.

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**Key observation**: A is upper triangular! This makes life easier.

For eigenvalues, we solve det(A - lambdaI) = 0

Since A is triangular, the determinant is just the product of diagonal entries:

det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = 0

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces

**For lambda = 2:**
Solve (A - 2I)v = 0:

```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```

This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, and v_1 is free

**Eigenspace for lambda = 2:** span{(1, 0, 0)^T}  
-> Geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:**
Solve (A - 3I)v = 0:

```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From the equations: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**Eigenspace for lambda = 3:** span{(1, 1, 1)^T}  
-> Geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**No!** Here's why:
- For diagonalizability, we need: geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for each eigenvalue
- For lambda = 2: algebraic mult. = 2, but geometric mult. = 1  
- We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for a 3*3 matrix

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**What does non-diagonalizable mean geometrically?**

A diagonalizable matrix can be completely understood as stretching along independent eigendirections. A non-diagonalizable matrix has a ""defect""-it doesn't have enough eigenvectors to span the space. This means there are **shearing** effects in addition to stretching.

Think of it like: some directions get stretched (eigenspaces), but because we're missing eigenvectors, the transformation also ""drags"" nearby vectors along with it in certain directions.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

*If A were diagonalizable:* A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (super easy!)

*Since A is NOT diagonalizable:* We need the **Jordan normal form**  
A = PJP^-^1 where J is almost diagonal but has some 1's on the superdiagonal

The Jordan form for this A would be:
```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1, but computing J^1^0^0 is trickier-those 1's cause polynomial terms to appear.

**The challenge:** Jordan blocks raise to powers using binomial-like formulas, creating terms like n*2 ^-^1 rather than just 2 .

So the eigenvalues are: lambda_1 = 2 and lambda_2 = 3

To find algebraic multiplicities, I need to find the characteristic polynomi","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## (a) Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

To verify, find the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  |
                 | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

For upper triangular matrices: det = product of diagonal entries

**det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda) = 0**

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0
```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |     Row reduce to    | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |                 ->    | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |                      | 0  0  0 |
```
This gives: x_2 = 0, x_3 = 0, x_1 = free

**E_2 = span{[1, 0, 0]^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0
```
A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |
```
From equations: x_2 = x_1 and x_3 = x_2, so x_1 = x_2 = x_3

**E_3 = span{[1, 1, 1]^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO.**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). A matrix is diagonalizable iff geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for all eigenvalues.

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
- A diagonalizable matrix has enough eigenvectors to form a basis for R 
- Non-diagonalizable matrices have ""defective"" eigenvalues - not enough independent eigenvectors
- Geometrically, the transformation has a **shearing component** that can't be eliminated by change of basis
- The matrix combines scaling (from eigenvalues) with shearing/rotation that can't be separated

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For diagonalizable matrices: A = PDP^-^1, so **A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1** (easy!)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, use **Jordan Normal Form**:
A = PJP^-^1 where J = | 2  1  0 |
                     | 0  2  0 |
                     | 0  0  3 |

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 requires the formula for powers of Jordan blocks:
```
| lambda  1 |   = | lambda      nlambda ^-^1  |
| 0  lambda |     | 0      lambda      |
```

So J^1^0^0 involves terms like 100*2^9^9, not just 2^1^0^0 - more complex than diagonal case!

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

*For diagonalizable matrices:* B = PDP^-^1 -> B^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

*For non-diagonalizable matrices:* Must use **Jordan Normal Form**

Write J = D + N (diagonal + nilpotent):
- Since N^2 = 0, use binomial theorem: J^1^0^0 = D^1^0^0 + 100D^9^9N
- Then compute A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenges compared to diagonalizable case:**
1. Must find **generalized eigenvectors** (harder than regular eigenvectors)

3. Requires binomial expansion with nilpotent matrices

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up the coordinate system:
- The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The bead has mass m and the hoop has radius R

Let me use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis).

Position of the be","# Physics Assignment - Lagrangian Mechanics Solution

Great problem! This is a classic example of symmetry breaking and bifurcation. Let me walk you through it step by step.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let me place the origin at the center of the hoop with the z-axis vertical (along the rotation axis).

**Position of the bead in Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)  [negative because theta measured from bottom]

**Velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**

T = (m/2)(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and using trig identities:

x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 = R^2theta_dot^2 cos^2(theta) + R^2omega^2 sin^2(theta)

Therefore:
```
T = (m/2)R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]
```

**Potential Energy:**
```
U = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)
```

**Lagrangian:**
```
L = T - U = (mR^2/2)[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)] + mgR cos(theta)
```

**Euler-Lagrange equation:**

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot  
d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

**Equation of motion:**
```
theta_ddot = omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - (g/R)sin(theta)
```

Or factored:
```
theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R]
```

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):**

sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

**Solutions:**

1. **sin(theta) = 0** -> theta = 0 or theta = pi
2. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** -> requires omega^2 >= g/R

**Critical angular velocity:**
```
omegac = sqrt(g/R)
```

**Summary of equilibria:**
- **omega < omegac:** Only theta = 0 (bottom) and theta = pi (top)
- **omega >= omegac:** theta = 0, pi, and theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))

**Stability Analysis:**

Use the effective potential approach:

Veff(theta) = -mgR cos(theta) - (mR^2omega^2/2)sin^2(theta)

Stability requires d^2Veff/dtheta^2 > 0 at equilibrium.

d^2Veff/dtheta^2 = mgR cos(theta) - mR^2omega^2cos(2theta)

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
```
d^2Veff/dtheta^2|_0 = mR(g - Romega^2)
```
- **Stable** if omega < omegac
- **Unstable** if omega > omegac

**At theta = pi (top):**
```
d^2Veff/dtheta^2|pi = -mR(g + Romega^2) < 0
```
- **Always unstable**

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omegac):

After substitution:
```
d^2Veff/dtheta^2 = m(R^2omega^4 - g^2)/omega^2 > 0
```
- **Always stable** (when these equilibria exist)

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical meaning:**

1. **Low rotation (omega < omegac):** The bead remains at the bottom. Gravity dominates, and centrifugal effects are too weak to lift it.

2. **High rotation (omega > omegac):** The bottom becomes unstable. The bead moves to a new equilibrium position at angle theta_0 = arccos(g/(Romega^2)), where centrifugal force balances the tangential component of gravity.

3. **At omega -> inf:** theta_0 -> pi/2 (the bead approaches the equator).

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- At omega = omegac, the system undergoes a qualitative change
- One stable equilibrium (theta = 0) becomes unstable
- Two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically (+/-theta_0)
- The number and stability of equilibria change discontinuously

**Breakdown of assumptions at very high omega:**

1. **Air resistance:** At high speeds, drag becomes significant
2. **Hoop rigidity:** Centrifugal forces on the hoop itself may deform it
3. **Frictionless assumption:** Any tiny friction causes heating
4. **Bead integrity:** Material stress at high omega could deform/break the bead
5. **Constant omega:** Maintaining perfectly constant rotation becomes difficult
6. **Point mass approximation:** The bead's finite size matters at extreme speeds

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric Interpretation:**

When a matrix is **non-diagonalizable**, it means:
- We can't find a complete basis of eigenvectors for R 
- The transformation has ""shearing"" components that can't be purely represented by stretching along eigenvector directions
- Some directions get both scaled AND shifted (not just scaled like in the diagonalizable case)

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a diagonalizable matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, use the **Jordan Normal Form**:
A = PJP^-^1 where J is almost diagonal

```
J = | 2  1  0 |  (Jordan block for lambda=2, plus lambda=3)
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**The challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 is harder than D^1^0^0 because of the 1's above the diagonal. For a 2*2 Jordan block:

| lambda  1 |  = | lambda    nlambda ^-^1 |
| 0  lambda |    | 0     lambda    |

So J^1^0^0 involves terms like 100*2^9^9, not just 2^1^0^0 and 3^1^0^0.

- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop

I need to set up coordinates. Let's use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis).

Position of the bead:
- The bead is at angle theta","# Physics Assignment Solution - Rotating Hoop Problem

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let me use a coordinate system with the z-axis vertical (along the rotation axis), with origin at the hoop's center.

Position of the bead at angle theta from bottom:
- Distance from rotation axis: r = R sin(theta)
- Height: z = -R cos(theta)
- Azimuthal angle: phi = omegat (due to hoop rotation)

**Kinetic Energy:**

The bead has two velocity components:
1. Sliding motion on hoop (changing theta)
2. Circular motion from hoop rotation

In cylindrical coordinates:
- $\dot{r} = R\cos\theta \cdot \dot{\theta}$
- $v_\phi = r\dot{\phi} = R\sin\theta \cdot \omega$
- $\dot{z} = R\sin\theta \cdot \dot{\theta}$

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m(\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\phi}^2 + \dot{z}^2)$$

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m[R^2\cos^2\theta \cdot \dot{\theta}^2 + R^2\sin^2\theta \cdot \omega^2 + R^2\sin^2\theta \cdot \dot{\theta}^2]$$

$$T = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**

$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**

$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange equation: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta} \implies \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

Therefore:
$$mR^2\ddot{\theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

**Case 1:** $\sin\theta = 0$
- $\theta_1 = 0$ (bottom of hoop)  
- $\theta_2 = \pi$ (top of hoop)  

**Case 2:** $\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R} = 0$
- $\cos\theta = \frac{g}{R\omega^2}$
- This exists only when $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$
- $\theta_3 = \arccos\left(\frac{g}{R\omega^2}\right)$ and $\theta_4 = -\theta_3$ (by symmetry)

**Stability Analysis:**

For linear stability, examine $\frac{df}{d\theta}\bigg|_{\theta_0}$ where $f(\theta) = \sin\theta(\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R)$

$$f'(\theta) = \cos\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) - \omega^2\sin^2\theta$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$f'(0) = \omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$$

- **Stable** if $\omega^2 < g/R$ (i.e., $\omega < \omega_c$)
- **Unstable** if $\omega^2 > g/R$ (i.e., $\omega > \omega_c$)

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$f'(\pi) = -\left(-\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}\right) = \omega^2 + \frac{g}{R} > 0$$

**Always unstable**  

**At $\theta = \arccos(g/R\omega^2)$ when $\omega > \omega_c$:**

At this equilibrium, $\omega^2\cos\theta_0 - g/R = 0$, so:
$$f'(\theta_0) = 0 - \omega^2\sin^2\theta_0 = -\omega^2\sin^2\theta_0 < 0$$

**Stable**  

**Summary:**
| $\omega$ | Bottom ($\theta=0$) | Top ($\theta=\pi$) | Side ($\theta=\pm\arccos(g/R\omega^2)$) |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| $< \omega_c$ | **Stable** | Unstable | Don't exist |
| $> \omega_c$ | Unstable | Unstable | **Stable** |

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Bifurcation:**

This is a classic example of a **pitchfork bifurcation**. As the control parameter (omega) passes through the critical value $\omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$:

- **Below $\omega_c$:** Gravity dominates. The bead sits stably at the bottom.
  
- **At $\omega_c$:** The system reaches a critical point where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance at the bottom.

- **Above $\omega_c$:** Centrifugal effects dominate. The bottom becomes unstable, and two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically on either side. The bead is ""flung outward"" to a position where centrifugal force balances the inward component of gravity.

**Physical meaning:** At high rotation rates, the effective ""outward"" centrifugal force in the rotating frame overcomes gravity, pushing the bead away from the rotation axis.

**Assumptions that break down at very high omega:**

1. **Frictionless motion:** Real friction would dissipate energy and affect dynamics
2. **Rigid hoop:** Material stress could deform or break the hoop
3. **Bead stays on hoop:** At extreme omega, normal force could fail; bead might slip or the constraint might break
4. **Point mass approximation:** The bead's finite size becomes relevant
5. **Air resistance:** Becomes significant at high speeds
6. **Small oscillations:** Nonlinear effects become more pronounced

Great problem! This beautifully demonstrates spontaneous symmetry breaking in classical mechanics.  "

The matrix A is:

This is an upper triangular matrix, which makes finding eigenvalues straightforward.

**(a) Finding eigenvalues and algebraic multiplicities:**

For a triangular matrix, the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries.

So the","# Linear Algebra Help - Eigenvalues and Diagonalizability

Great problem! Let me guide you through this step-by-step.

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**What do you notice about matrix A?** It's upper triangular! This is a key observation.

For triangular matrices (upper or lower), the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

The characteristic polynomial is:
det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)

**Eigenvalues:**
- lambda = 2 with **algebraic multiplicity 2**
- lambda = 3 with **algebraic multiplicity 1**

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces

Now let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
| 0  1  0 |   |x|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | * |y| = |0|
| 0  0  1 |   |z|   |0|
```

From this system: y = 0, z = 0, x is free

**Eigenspace:** E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T} -> **geometric multiplicity = 1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
|-1  1  0 |   |x|   |0|
| 0 -1  1 | * |y| = |0|
| 0  0  0 |   |z|   |0|
```

From this: x = y = z (let this equal t)

**Eigenspace:** E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T} -> **geometric multiplicity = 1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**NO!** Here's why:

For lambda = 2: algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1)

A matrix is diagonalizable **only if** geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues. We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for a 3*3 matrix.

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
- A **diagonalizable** matrix represents a transformation that purely *scales* space along independent directions (the eigenvector directions)
- A **non-diagonalizable** matrix has a *shearing* component-it can't be decomposed into pure scaling. There aren't enough independent eigenvector directions to form a complete basis

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

*For diagonalizable matrices:* A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

*For non-diagonalizable matrices:* We need **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where

```
J = | 2  1  0 |  <- Jordan block
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

**Challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 is harder because of the 1's above the diagonal. For a 2*2 Jordan block |lambda 1|, we get (lambdaI + N)  where we need the binomial theorem.
                                                                      |0 lambda|

This is an upper triangular matrix. For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries.

So the eigenvalues are:

## (a) Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries.

**Finding the characteristic polynomial:**

                 | 0    2-lambda   1  |

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:**
Solve (A - 2I)v = 0:
```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|

This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:**
Solve (A - 3I)v = 0:

```
This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3 (set equal to t)

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO.**

**Justification:** A 3*3 matrix is diagonalizable iff we can find 3 linearly independent eigenvectors. We only have 2 eigenvectors total (one for each eigenspace). Alternatively, for lambda = 2, the algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1), which guarantees non-diagonalizability.

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation of non-diagonalizability:**

A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that can be completely described as stretching/compressing along independent directions (the eigenvectors). 

A **non-diagonalizable** matrix has a ""defect""-there aren't enough eigenvector directions to span the space. The transformation includes **shearing** in addition to scaling. In our case, lambda = 2 ""wants"" 2 independent eigenvectors but only has 1, creating a shearing effect in that 2-dimensional eigenspace.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a diagonalizable matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

Since A is **not diagonalizable**, we use **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J is the Jordan form
- For our matrix: J = | 2  1  0 |
                       | 0  2  0 |
                       | 0  0  3 |

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 is harder because of the off-diagonal 1. We need the binomial theorem:
```
J^1^0^0 = | 2^1^0^0   100*2^9^9    0   |
       | 0      2^1^0^0        0   |
       | 0      0         3^1^0^0 |
```

The off-diagonal terms grow, making computation more complex than simply raising diagonal entries to the 100th power.

Let me work through it systematically.

**Part (a): Derive the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up coordinates. The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with constant angular velocity omega. Let's use theta as the angle measured from the bottom of the hoop.

Position of the bead:
- The bead is at angle theta from the bottom
- The hoop rotates with angular velocity omega about the vertical axis

Using cyli","# Physics Assignment Solution - Rotating Hoop

Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- theta = angle from bottom of hoop
- Hoop rotates about vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- Bead is at radius r = R sin theta from the rotation axis
- Height: z = -R cos theta (from center of hoop)

**Kinetic Energy:**
The bead has two velocity contributions:
1. Motion along the hoop: velocity = Rtheta_dot
2. Circular motion from rotation: velocity = omegaR sin theta

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m[(R\dot{\theta})^2 + (\omega R \sin\theta)^2] = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Euler-Lagrange Equation:**
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$ -> $\frac{d}{dt} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

**Equation of motion:**
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$, $\dot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives two cases:

**1) theta = 0 or theta = pi** (bottom and top)

**2)** $\cos\theta = \frac{g}{\omega^2 R}$ (requires $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$)

So: $\theta_{eq} = \pm \arccos\left(\frac{g}{\omega^2 R}\right)$

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium: $\theta = \theta_{eq} + \epsilon$

Taking $\frac{df}{d\theta}$ where $f(\theta) = \sin\theta(\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R)$:

$$f'(\theta) = \cos\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) - \omega^2\sin^2\theta$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$f'(0) = \omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$$

- If $\omega < \omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$: $f'(0) < 0$ -> **STABLE**
- If $\omega > \omega_c$: $f'(0) > 0$ -> **UNSTABLE**

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$f'(\pi) = \omega^2 + \frac{g}{R} > 0$$ -> **Always UNSTABLE**

**At** $\theta_{eq} = \arccos(g/(\omega^2 R))$ **(when it exists):**
$$f'(\theta_{eq}) = -\omega^2\sin^2\theta_{eq} < 0$$ -> **STABLE**

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical Meaning:**
- At low rotation speeds, gravity dominates -> bead sits at bottom
- At high speeds, centrifugal effects dominate -> bead moves outward to maximize distance from rotation axis
- The equilibrium position balances gravitational torque (pulling down) against the ""centrifugal"" effect (pushing outward)

**Bifurcation:**
This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For $\omega < \omega_c$: ONE stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- For $\omega > \omega_c$: theta = 0 becomes unstable, TWO new stable equilibria appear symmetrically at $\pm\theta_{eq}$
- At $\omega = \omega_c$: critical point where the system behavior changes qualitatively

**Model Breakdown at High omega:**
1. **Friction becomes significant** - air resistance scales with velocity
2. **Bead may fly off** - assumes constraint force (normal force) keeps bead on hoop; at high omega this may require unrealistic forces
3. **Material deformation** - hoop may deform or break
4. **Quantum effects** - at extreme speeds (not realistic, but theoretically)
5. **Relativistic effects** - if omegaR approaches c (highly unrealistic)

  - x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
  - y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
  - z = -R cos theta (negative since theta = 0 at bottom)

**Finding velocities:**

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria:** Set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$

From $\sin\theta(\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R) = 0$:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top) - always exists  
3. **$\cos\theta = \frac{g}{R\omega^2}$** - exists only if $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$

   This gives $\theta_{eq} = \pm\arccos\left(\frac{g}{R\omega^2}\right)$ (symmetric positions on sides)

**Stability analysis:**

Use effective potential or linearize around equilibria. The effective potential is:
$$U_{eff}(\theta) = -mgR\cos\theta - \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta$$

Stability determined by $\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{d\theta^2}$:

$$\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{d\theta^2} = mgR\cos\theta - mR^2\omega^2\cos(2\theta)$$

**At theta = 0:**
$$\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{d\theta^2}\bigg|_{\theta=0} = mR(g - R\omega^2)$$

- **Stable if** $\omega < \omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$
- **Unstable if** $\omega > \omega_c$

**At theta = pi:** Always unstable (d^2U/dtheta^2 < 0)

**At side equilibria** $\theta = \arccos(g/R\omega^2)$: **Stable** (can verify by checking second derivative > 0)

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation and Bifurcation

**Physical meaning:**

At low rotation rates, gravity dominates and the bead sits at the bottom. As omega increases, the centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) pushes the bead outward. At **omega = omegac**, the bottom becomes unstable and the bead moves to new equilibrium positions on the sides of the hoop where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For $\omega < \omega_c$: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- At $\omega = \omega_c$: bifurcation point (critical transition)
- For $\omega > \omega_c$: three equilibria - one unstable at bottom, two stable at $\pm\arccos(g/R\omega^2)$

The number and stability of equilibria change qualitatively at the critical parameter value.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Friction becomes significant** - even ""frictionless"" systems have some drag; at high speeds this matters
2. **Deformation of hoop** - centrifugal forces may deform the hoop from circular
3. **Air resistance** - becomes non-negligible at high speeds
4. **Rigidity of rotation** - maintaining constant omega requires infinite torque ideally
5. **Bead stays on hoop** - normal force requirement may be violated

- The vertical diameter as the z-axis
- The hoop lies in a plane that rotates

Position of the bead:
In the rotating frame, the bead is a","# Physics Assignment Solution: Rotating Hoop Problem

Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Place the center of the hoop at the origin
- Let the hoop rotate about the vertical (z) axis
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop

**Position in inertial frame:**
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta (negative since theta = 0 is at bottom)

**Velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin theta * theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**
T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and simplifying (the cross terms cancel):
$$T = \frac{m}{2}R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$U = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{m}{2}R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**
Using Euler-Lagrange equation: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$
- $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$):
$$\sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

This gives two cases:

**Case 1:** $\sin\theta = 0$ -> $\theta = 0$ or $\theta = \pi$

**Case 2:** $\cos\theta = \frac{g}{R\omega^2}$

For Case 2 to have real solutions: $\frac{g}{R\omega^2} \leq 1$, which means $\omega \geq \sqrt{g/R}$

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**Stability Analysis:**
Linearize around equilibrium: if $\theta = \theta_0 + \epsilon$, stability requires:
$$\frac{d}{d\theta}\left[\sin\theta(\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R)\right]\bigg|_{\theta_0} < 0$$

This gives:
$$f'(\theta) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- $f'(0) = \omega^2 - g/R$
- Stable if $\omega < \omega_c$  
- **Unstable if $\omega > \omega_c$**  

**At theta = pi (top):**
- $f'(\pi) = \omega^2 + g/R > 0$ 
- **Always unstable**  

**At $\theta = \pm\arccos(g/R\omega^2)$ (when $\omega > \omega_c$):**
- Can show $f'(\theta) < 0$
- **Stable**  

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Bifurcation behavior:**
This is a **supercritical pitchfork bifurcation**:

- **omega < omegac:** Bead stable at bottom (theta = 0)
- **omega = omegac:** Bifurcation point-bottom position becomes marginally stable
- **omega > omegac:** Bottom becomes unstable; two new symmetric stable equilibria appear on sides of hoop

**Physical intuition:** 
At low speeds, gravity dominates and pulls the bead to the bottom. As rotation speed increases, centrifugal effects (in the rotating frame) create an outward force. Above omegac, this outward force overcomes the restoring force from gravity, and the bead is flung to a position where these forces balance.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**
1. **Friction/air resistance** becomes significant (we assumed frictionless)
2. **Hoop rigidity** - centrifugal forces might deform the hoop
3. **Point mass approximation** - the bead's finite size matters
4. **Material limits** - the hoop could fail structurally
5. **Contact assumption** - bead might lose contact with hoop or vibrate

What's the assignment?",0,1919,1919,2539,28.43,"Great! This is a linear algebra problem about eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalizability. Let me work through this systematically.

**Part (a): Find eigenvalues and algebraic multiplicities**

The matrix A is:
A = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  1 |
    | 0  0  3 |

This is an upper triangular matrix. For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries!

So the eigenvalues are: lambda_1 = 2, lambda_2 = 2, lambda_3 = 3

Actually, let me verify by computing det(A - lambdaI):
A - lambdaI = | 2-lambda   1    0  |
 ","I'll help you work through this linear algebra problem step by step!

## Part (a): Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is an upper triangular matrix**, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries!

To verify, let's find the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  |
                 | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

For a triangular matrix, the determinant is the product of diagonal entries:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)
```

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0
```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From the equations: v_2 = 0 and v_3 = 0, so v_1 is free.

**Eigenspace for lambda = 2:** span{**[1, 0, 0]^T**} -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0
```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From the equations: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**Eigenspace for lambda = 3:** span{**[1, 1, 1]^T**} -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**NO!** A is **not diagonalizable** because:
- For lambda = 2: algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1)
- We can only find 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for a 3*3 matrix

---

## Part (c): Geometric Meaning and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric Interpretation:**

When a matrix is **non-diagonalizable**, it means the linear transformation cannot be represented as pure scaling along independent directions. Geometrically:
- A diagonalizable matrix stretches/shrinks space along n independent axes
- A non-diagonalizable matrix has ""deficient"" eigenspaces-it also includes **shearing** components that can't be separated from the scaling

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

Since A isn't diagonalizable, we use the **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

For this matrix:
```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |  (Jordan block for lambda=2, then lambda=3)
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

For the Jordan block:
```
| 2  1 |^1^0^0   | 2^1^0^0   100*2^9^9 |
| 0  2 |    = | 0      2^1^0^0    |
```

**Challenges compared to diagonalizable matrices:**
- **Diagonalizable:** D^1^0^0 is trivial-just raise each diagonal entry to the 100th power
- **Non-diagonalizable:** Jordan blocks create off-diagonal terms that grow polynomially (like 100*2^9^9), making computation more complex

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up a coordinate system. The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega. Let me use theta as the angle from the bottom of the hoop.

Position of the bead:
- If the hoop is rotating about the vertical (z) axis, and theta is measured from the bottom, I can write the position in cylind","Great problem! This is a classic example in analytical mechanics. Let me walk you through each part:

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Place the hoop's center at the origin
- z-axis points vertically upward  
- The hoop rotates about the z-axis with angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the **bottom** of the hoop

**Position of the bead:**
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta) + (constant, if center is at origin)

**Finding velocities:**
Taking time derivatives:
- x_dot = R theta_dot cos(theta) cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R theta_dot cos(theta) sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R theta_dot sin(theta)

**Kinetic energy:**
T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and using trig identities:
x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 = R^2theta_dot^2cos^2(theta) + R^2omega^2sin^2(theta)

Therefore:
**T =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2sin^2(theta)]**

**Potential energy:**
V = mg(height) = -mgR cos(theta)

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of motion using Euler-Lagrange:**

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

Applying d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0:

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\sin\theta = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

sin(theta_0)[omega^2cos(theta_0) - g/R] = 0

This gives:

1. **sin(theta_0) = 0** -> theta_0 = 0 (bottom) or theta_0 = pi (top)
2. **cos(theta_0) = g/(Romega^2)** (only exists if omega^2 >= g/R)

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium: theta = theta_0 +   (small perturbation)

The linearized equation is:  _ddot = V''(theta_0)  where

V''(theta) = omega^2(cos(2theta)) - (g/R)cos(theta)

Or more directly:
$$\frac{d}{d\theta}\left[\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\sin\theta\right] = \omega^2(\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

**For theta_0 = 0 (bottom):**
- V''(0) = omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable if omega < omegac = sqrt(g/R)**
- **Unstable if omega > omegac**

**For theta_0 = pi (top):**
- V''(pi) = omega^2 + g/R > 0
- **Always unstable**

**For cos(theta_0) = g/(Romega^2)** (when omega > omegac):
- V''(theta_0) = g^2/(R^2omega^2) - omega^2 < 0 (since omega > omegac)
- **These are stable** (two symmetric positions)

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical Meaning:**

At slow rotation (omega < omegac), gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom. As rotation increases, the centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) creates an effective potential that can balance gravity at an angle.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- omega < omegac: One stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- omega = omegac: Bifurcation point
- omega > omegac: Bottom becomes unstable, two new stable equilibria appear symmetrically on either side

The number and stability of equilibria change qualitatively at omegac.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **No friction/air resistance** - becomes significant at high speeds
2. **Rigid constraint** - bead might slip or hop off the hoop
3. **Rigid hoop** - could deform or break due to centrifugal stress
4. **Point mass approximation** - extended bead would experience additional torques
5. **Classical mechanics** - at extreme omega, relativistic effects matter
6. **Small angle stability analysis** - only valid near equilibria

Part (a): Setting up the Lagrangian

2. Need to find potential energy V","Great problem! This is a classic example in analytical mechanics. Let me guide you through it step by step.

## Part (a): Setting up the Lagrangian

**First, let's establish our coordinate system:**
- theta measured from bottom of hoop (so theta = 0 is the bottom, theta = pi is the top)
- Hoop rotates about vertical diameter with constant omega

**Now, what do you need for the Lagrangian?**
L = T - V (kinetic energy minus potential energy)

**Let me help you find the position of the bead:**

If theta is measured from the bottom, the bead's position in cylindrical coordinates (or Cartesian) is:
- Vertical height: z = R(1 - cos theta) [measuring from bottom]
- Distance from rotation axis: r = R sin theta

**Can you now write down the velocity components?**

The bead has two velocity contributions:
1. Motion due to changing theta: speed = R(dtheta/dt)
2. Circular motion due to hoop rotation: speed = omega * (distance from axis) = omegaR sin theta

The total kinetic energy is:
**T = (1/2)m[R^2(dtheta/dt)^2 + (omegaR sin theta)^2]**

The potential energy is:
**V = mgz = mgR(1 - cos theta)**

So the Lagrangian is:
**L = (1/2)mR^2(dtheta/dt)^2 + (1/2)momega^2R^2 sin^2theta - mgR(1 - cos theta)**

**Now apply the Euler-Lagrange equation:**
d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

Can you try computing these partial derivatives?

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium and Stability

**Hint for equilibrium positions:**
At equilibrium, theta_dot = 0 and theta_ddot = 0. This means the bead sits at a fixed angle. What does your equation of motion tell you when theta_ddot = 0?

**Hint for stability:**
Look at the ""effective potential"" or use the second derivative test. Small perturbations around equilibrium - do they grow or decay?

- No friction

I should guide them through:
(a) Setting up coordinates, finding kinetic and potential energy,","# Physics Help: Rotating Hoop Problem

Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me guide you through each part.

## (a) Setting up the Lagrangian

**Step 1: Establish the coordinate system**

Let me help you visualize this:
- The hoop rotates about a vertical axis (call it the z-axis)
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The bead is at position theta on the hoop

**Step 2: Find the position of the bead**

In a coordinate system, the bead's position is:
- Height above lowest point: `z = R(1 - cos theta)`
- Distance from rotation axis: `r = R sin theta`
- Angular position: `phi = omegat` (forced by the rotating hoop)

**Step 3: Calculate kinetic energy**

The bead has three velocity components:
- Radial: `r_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot`
- Tangential (from rotation): `v_tangential = romega = Romega sin theta`
- Vertical: `z_dot = R sin theta * theta_dot`

So:
```
T =  m(r_dot^2 + r^2omega^2 + z_dot^2)
T =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 cos^2theta + omega^2 sin^2theta + theta_dot^2 sin^2theta]
T =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2theta]
```

**Step 4: Potential energy**

`V = mgR(1 - cos theta)`

**Step 5: The Lagrangian**

```
L = T - V =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2theta - mgR(1 - cos theta)
```

**Step 6: Equation of motion** (Euler-Lagrange)

Can you apply `d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0`?

You should get:
```
theta_ddot = sin theta(omega^2 cos theta - g/R)
```

---

## (b) Equilibrium and Stability

**Finding equilibria:** Set theta_ddot = 0

`sin theta(omega^2 cos theta - g/R) = 0`

This gives:
1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)
2. **cos theta = g/(Romega^2)** -> exists only if **omega >= sqrt(g/R)**

**Stability analysis:** Linearize around each equilibrium

*At theta = 0 (bottom):*
- Let theta =   (small). Then: ` _ddot ~=  (omega^2 - g/R)`
- **Stable if omega < omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**
- **Unstable if omega > omega_c**

*At theta = pi (top):*
- Always **unstable** (try the linearization yourself!)

*At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2)):*
- These exist for omega > omega_c
- Can show these are **stable** (requires checking second derivative of effective potential)

**Critical angular velocity:**
```
omega_c = sqrt(g/R)
```

---

## (c) Physical Interpretation

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

At omega = omega_c, the system undergoes a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omega_c: One stable equilibrium at bottom
- For omega > omega_c: Bottom becomes unstable, two NEW stable equilibria appear symmetrically

This is spontaneous symmetry breaking! The bead ""chooses"" to sit at an angle rather than the bottom.

**Physical intuition:**
- At low omega: Gravity dominates -> bead stays at bottom
- At high omega: Centrifugal effect dominates -> bead is ""thrown outward"" to a tilted position

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**
1. **Bead stays on hoop** - centrifugal force might exceed normal force capability
2. **Rigid hoop** - might deform under stress
3. **No air resistance** - becomes significant at high speeds
4. **Point particle** - bead has finite size
5. **Perfect constraint** - real systems have some give

Wait, let me be more careful. The characteristic polynomial is:
det(A - lambdaI) = ","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

To verify, find the characteristic polynomial:
$$\det(A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 2-\lambda & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2-\lambda & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 3-\lambda \end{pmatrix}$$

For a triangular matrix, the determinant is the product of diagonal entries:
$$\det(A - \lambda I) = (2-\lambda)^2(3-\lambda)$$

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces and Checking Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:**

Solve $(A - 2I)\vec{v} = \vec{0}$:

$$A - 2I = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

This gives: $v_2 = 0$, $v_3 = 0$, $v_1$ is free

$$E_2 = \text{span}\left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\right\}$$ 

**Geometric multiplicity = 1**

**For lambda = 3:**

Solve $(A - 3I)\vec{v} = \vec{0}$:

$$A - 3I = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

This gives: $v_2 = v_1$ and $v_3 = v_2$, so $v_3 = v_2 = v_1$

$$E_3 = \text{span}\left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\right\}$$

**Geometric multiplicity = 1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**NO.** A matrix is diagonalizable iff geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for all eigenvalues.

For lambda = 2: algebraic mult. = 2, but geometric mult. = 1  

We only have **2 linearly independent eigenvectors** total, but we need **3** for diagonalization.

---

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^100

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**

A diagonalizable matrix has enough eigenvectors to form a basis-meaning there exist directions that are only **scaled** (not rotated/sheared) by the transformation. 

A non-diagonalizable matrix has **deficient eigenspaces**-some directions experience **shearing** in addition to scaling. The matrix can't be fully decomposed into independent scaling operations along different axes.

**Computing A^100:**

For a **diagonalizable** matrix: If $A = PDP^{-1}$, then $A^{100} = PD^{100}P^{-1}$ (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices like this one, use the **Jordan Normal Form**:
$$A = PJP^{-1}$$

where $J = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$ (Jordan block)

Then $A^{100} = PJ^{100}P^{-1}$

**The challenge:** Computing $J^{100}$ is harder because of the ""1"" above the diagonal. You need to use the binomial theorem:
$$J^{100} = \begin{pmatrix} 2^{100} & 100 \cdot 2^{99} & 0 \\ 0 & 2^{100} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3^{100} \end{pmatrix}$$

Much more involved than just raising diagonal entries to the 100th power!

## Part (a): Setting up the Lagrangian

**First, let's establish our coordinate system:**
- Vertical hoop with center at origin, rotating about vertical (z) axis
- theta measured from bottom of hoop
- Hoop rotates at constant angular velocity omega

**Position of the bead in the lab frame:**

Think about where the bead is:
- Distance from rotation axis: `r = R sin(theta)`
- Height: `z = -R cos(theta)` (center at origin)
- Azimuthal position: `phi = omegat`

**Now derive the kinetic energy:**

In Cartesian coordinates:
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

Can you calculate the velocity components x_dot, y_dot, z_dot by differentiating these? Remember theta is time-dependent but omega is constant.

<details>
<summary>Click after you try it</summary>

After differentiating and computing v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2, you should get:

**T = (1/2)m R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]**

The first term is motion along the hoop, the second is circular motion from rotation.

**Potential energy:**
V = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)

**Therefore the Lagrangian is:**
```
L = T - V = (1/2)mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)] + mgR cos(theta)

## Part (b): Equilibrium and Stability

sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

This gives two cases. What are they?

1. **sin(theta) = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)
2. **omega^2 cos(theta) = g/R** -> cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)

The second solution only exists when g/(Romega^2) <= 1, i.e., when **omega >= sqrt(g/R)**
</details>

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize around each equilibrium. For small perturbation   around equilibrium theta_0:

theta = theta_0 +  , expand to first order in  .

**For theta = 0 (bottom):**
- sin( ) ~=  , cos( ) ~= 1
-  _ddot ~=  [omega^2 - g/R]

If omega^2 < g/R: coefficient is negative -> **stable** (oscillates)
If omega^2 > g/R: coefficient is positive -> **unstable** (exponential growth)

**Critical angular velocity: omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

**For theta = pi (top):**
Try this yourself - it's always unstable!

**For theta_0 where cos(theta_0) = g/(Romega^2):**
These exist when omega > omegac and turn out to be **stable**.

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

At omega = omegac = sqrt(g/R), the system undergoes a **pitchfork bifurcation**:

- **omega < omegac**: Bead sits stably at bottom. Centrifugal effect too weak to overcome gravity.

- **omega = omegac**: Critical point - bottom equilibrium becomes marginally stable

- **omega > omegac**: Bottom becomes unstable, two new stable equilibria appear at angles +/-theta_0 where cos(theta_0) = g/(Romega^2). The bead ""climbs up"" the hoop!

This is **spontaneous symmetry breaking** - even though the system is rotationally symmetric about the vertical axis, the bead must choose to sit at some specific azimuthal angle.

**Physical meaning:**
The centrifugal force   omega^2R sin(theta) pushes the bead outward. At high omega, this dominates gravity, forcing the bead away from the bottom.

**Assumptions that break down at very high omega:**

1. **Rigid hoop** - would deform/break under centrifugal stress
2. **Frictionless constraint** - air resistance becomes significant
3. **Bead stays on hoop** - could fly off if normal force becomes unrealistic
4. **Non-relativistic** - if omegaR approaches c

The matrix is:
A = | 2  1  0 |

Since this is upper triangular, the ","Great linear algebra problem! Let me help you work through this step-by-step. I'll guide you through the process so you understand the concepts.

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

**Key insight:** Notice that A is an **upper triangular matrix**. What's special about the eigenvalues of triangular matrices?

For any triangular matrix, the eigenvalues are just the **diagonal entries**!

To verify, find det(A - lambdaI):
```
A - lambdaI = | 2-lambda   1    0  |
         | 0    2-lambda   1  |
         | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

Since it's triangular: det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = **(2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Answer:**
- lambda = **2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- lambda = **3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces & Diagonalizability

Now you need to find eigenvectors by solving (A - lambdaI)v = 0 for each eigenvalue.

**For lambda = 2:**
```
(A - 2I)v = | 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
            | 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
            | 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From this: v_2 = 0 and v_3 = 0, but v_1 is free.

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:**
```
(A - 3I)v = | -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
            |  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
            |  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```

This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**NO!** Here's why:
- For diagonalizability, geometric multiplicity must equal algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues
- For lambda = 2: algebraic mult. = 2, but geometric mult. = 1  
- We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors, but need 3 for a 3*3 matrix

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^100

**Geometric interpretation:**
- A **diagonalizable** matrix = pure scaling along independent axis directions (the eigenvectors)
- A **non-diagonalizable** matrix = scaling PLUS shearing/rotation that can't be separated
- The eigenvalue lambda = 2 ""wants"" a 2D eigenspace but only gets 1D -> creates a shear in that missing dimension

**Computing A^100:**

*If A were diagonalizable:*
- Write A = PDP^-^1 (where D is diagonal)
- Then A^100 = PD^100P^-^1
- D^100 is trivial: just raise each diagonal entry to the 100th power!

*Since A is NOT diagonalizable:*
- Must use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1
- J has Jordan blocks (eigenvalues on diagonal, with 1's above for repeated eigenvalues)
- Computing J^100 requires the **binomial theorem** because J^n = (D + N)^n where N is nilpotent
- Much messier! You get terms like (100 choose k) * 2^(100-k) from the Jordan block structure

**The challenge:** Non-diagonal Jordan blocks don't satisfy J^n = diag(lambda_1^n, lambda_2^n, ...), making exponentiation much more complicated.

**Key insight**: Notice that A is upper triangular (all entries below the diagonal are 0).

For triangular matrices, what's special about finding eigenvalues? 

<details>
<summary>Think about it first, then expand</summary>

The eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**! 

Why? The characteristic polynomial is det(A - lambdaI), and for a triangular matrix, this determinant equals the product of diagonal entries.
</details>

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

Now find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
| 0  1  0 | |x|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |y| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |z|   |0|
```

What does this tell you about y and z? What about x?

You should get: **E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
|-1  1  0 | |x|   |0|
| 0 -1  1 | |y| = |0|
| 0  0  0 | |z|   |0|
```

Working backward: z = y, and x = y, so eigenvectors are of the form t(1, 1, 1).

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**No!** Here's why:
- We need 3 linearly independent eigenvectors (one for each dimension)
- We only found 2 eigenvectors total
- For lambda = 2: algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1)   

*A matrix is diagonalizable iff geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues.*

---

## Part (c): Geometric Meaning & Computing A^100

**Geometric interpretation of non-diagonalizable matrices:**

A diagonalizable matrix has a complete basis of eigenvectors-meaning it only stretches/shrinks along independent directions. 

A **non-diagonalizable** matrix has a ""defect""-it includes **shearing** in addition to stretching. The repeated eigenvalue lambda=2 doesn't have enough independent directions, so the transformation also slides vectors along those directions.

**Computing A^100:**

*For a diagonalizable matrix:* A = PDP^-^1, so A^100 = PD^100P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100)

*For non-diagonalizable A:* You need **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J is almost diagonal with 1's on the super-diagonal
- J = | 2  1  0 |
      | 0  2  0 |
      | 0  0  3 |

- Computing J^100 involves binomial expansion: harder than diagonal matrices!

**The challenge:** J^n != just raising diagonal entries to n. You get terms like n*2^(n-1) from the Jordan block.

A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> dimension = 1 (geometric multiplicity = 1)

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |

This gives us: v_2 = v_3 and v_1 = v_2, so v = (1, 1, 1)t

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> dimension = 1

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**No!** For lambda = 2: geometric multiplicity (1) < algebraic multiplicity (2)

A matrix is diagonalizable only if geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for all eigenvalues. We're missing an eigenvector!

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
- Diagonalizable matrices have enough eigenvectors to form a basis for the space
- Non-diagonalizable matrices have ""defective"" eigenvalues - they don't have enough independent eigenvectors
- Geometrically, this means the transformation can't be broken down into simple scaling along independent directions
- Our matrix has a **shear component** (the 1's above the diagonal) that couples the dimensions together

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

*For diagonalizable matrices:* A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to the 100th power)

*For non-diagonalizable matrices:* Must use **Jordan Normal Form**
- A = PJP^-^1 where J has Jordan blocks
- Or use A = D + N decomposition (diagonal + nilpotent)
- Much more computational work!

Alternatively, you could compute it directly using the fact that A = D + N where D is diagonal and N is strictly upper triangular (and nilpotent), then use the binomial theorem - but this is tedious for high powers.

## Setup:

- Hoop rotates about vertical diameter with constant angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- No friction

## Part (a): Lagrangian and equation of motion

First, I need to set up coordinates. Let me use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis), and the hoop rotates in","# Physics Assignment Solution - Rotating Hoop Problem

I'll help you work through this classic Lagrangian mechanics problem step by step.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

In the lab frame, with the z-axis vertical (along rotation axis):
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)  [negative since theta = 0 is at bottom]

**Finding velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic energy:**

T = (m/2)(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

Computing x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 (the cross terms cancel):

T = (m/2)R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]

**Potential energy:**

V = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)

**Lagrangian:**

**L = (m/2)R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)] + mgR cos(theta)**

**Equation of motion using Euler-Lagrange:**

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot  ->  d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

Therefore:

**theta_ddot = omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - (g/R)sin(theta)**

Or factored: **theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R]**

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):**

sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

This gives:

1. **sin(theta) = 0**  ->  **theta = 0** (bottom) or **theta = pi** (top)

2. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)**  ->  **theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))**
   - Only exists if g/(Romega^2) <= 1, i.e., **omega >= sqrt(g/R)   omegac**

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium theta_0: let theta = theta_0 +  

 _ddot ~= [d^2U_eff/dtheta^2]|_{theta_0} *  , where the coefficient is:

d/dtheta[omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - (g/R)sin(theta)] = omega^2[cos(2theta)] - (g/R)cos(theta)

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- Coefficient = omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable if omega < omegac**
- **Unstable if omega > omegac**

**Critical angular velocity: omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

**At theta = pi (top):**
- Coefficient = omega^2 + g/R > 0
- **Always unstable**

**At theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2)) (when omega > omegac):**
- Can show coefficient = g^2/(R^2omega^2) - omega^2 < 0 for omega > omegac
- **Stable when they exist**

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Bifurcation behavior:**

This is a **supercritical pitchfork bifurcation**:

- **omega < omegac**: Only the bottom (theta = 0) is stable. Gravity dominates.
- **omega = omegac**: Bifurcation point - bottom becomes marginally stable
- **omega > omegac**: Bottom becomes unstable, two symmetric stable equilibria emerge at theta != 0

**Physical meaning:**

In the rotating frame, the bead experiences an outward ""centrifugal force""   omega^2R sin(theta). At low rotation rates, gravity wins and pulls the bead to the bottom. Above omegac, the centrifugal effect dominates, pushing the bead to a position where it balances gravity while rotating at a fixed angle from vertical.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Hoop rigidity** - centrifugal stress could deform or break the hoop
2. **Bead constraint** - the bead might not maintain contact (normal force -> 0)
3. **Air resistance** - becomes significant at high speeds
4. **Small perturbations** - vibrations, wobbling of the hoop
5. **Material limits** - heating from any residual friction

## Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

First, I need to set up a coordinate system. Let's use:
- The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The bead is at position along the hoop

**Setting up coordinates:**
In a fixed (inertial) frame with the z-axis vertical and the hoop rotating ab","# Physics Homework Solution: Rotating Hoop Problem

Great problem! Let me walk you through this classic Lagrangian mechanics example.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

In an inertial frame with z-axis vertical (axis of rotation):
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta) (measuring from hoop center, negative since theta=0 is at bottom)

**Velocity components:**
- x_dot = Rtheta_dot cos(theta) cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = Rtheta_dot cos(theta) sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = Rtheta_dot sin(theta)

**Kinetic Energy:**

T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

When you expand and simplify (the cross terms cancel):

**T =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2(theta)**

**Potential Energy:**

V = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)

**Lagrangian:**

**L =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2(theta) + mgR cos(theta)**

**Euler-Lagrange equation:** d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot -> d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

**Equation of motion:**

**theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R]**

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria:** Set theta_ddot = 0:

sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

This gives:
1. **sin(theta) = 0** -> theta = 0 or pi
2. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** -> theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2)) (only exists if omega >= sqrt(g/R))

**Stability analysis:**

For small perturbations about equilibrium, linearize to get:
 _ddot = f'(theta_eq)* 

where f'(theta) = omega^2cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos(theta)

Stable if f'(theta_eq) < 0, unstable if f'(theta_eq) > 0.

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- f'(0) = omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable if omega < omega_c**, **unstable if omega > omega_c**
- **Critical angular velocity: omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**

**At theta = pi (top):**
- f'(pi) = omega^2 + g/R > 0
- **Always unstable**

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omega_c):
- f'(theta_eq) = g^2/(R^2omega^2) - omega^2 < 0 for omega > omega_c
- **Stable** (these are the ""tilted"" equilibria)

## Part (c): Physical Discussion

**Physical meaning:**

This system demonstrates **spontaneous symmetry breaking**:

- At **low rotation rates** (omega < omega_c): The bead stays at the bottom due to gravity
- At **high rotation rates** (omega > omega_c): The centrifugal effect dominates, and the bead is pushed outward to a tilted position where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance

**Bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation** because:
- Below omega_c: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- Above omega_c: the bottom becomes unstable and two new stable equilibria appear symmetrically (at +/-theta_0)

The system's behavior changes qualitatively at the critical point.

**Model breakdown at high omega:**

1. **Friction becomes important** - air resistance grows with v^2
2. **Material stress** - the hoop may deform or break
3. **Bead may slip** - ""frictionless"" assumption fails as normal force increases
4. **Relativistic effects** (extremely high omega!)
5. **Small oscillations** may become large amplitude, invalidating linearization

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

**Eigenvalues:**
- lambda = 2 with algebraic multiplicity 2
- lambda = 3 with algebraic multiplicity 1

**Verification:** The characteristic polynomial is:
det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = **(2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|

This gives v_2 = 0 and v_3 = 0, so v_1 is free.

This gives v_1 = v_2 = v_3.

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = 1

**Is A diagonalizable? NO!  **

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors, but need 3 to diagonalize a 3*3 matrix.

## (c) Geometric Meaning and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric Interpretation:**
A non-diagonalizable matrix cannot be decomposed into pure scaling along independent directions. It combines **scaling** with **shearing**. The ""missing"" eigenvector means one direction gets stretched while also being skewed toward another direction-this cannot be separated no matter what basis you choose.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

**For diagonalizable matrices:** A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

**For non-diagonalizable matrices:** Use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

For this matrix, J would be:
```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Computing J^1^0^0 requires handling the Jordan block. Since J = D + N where N is nilpotent:

**J^1^0^0 = D^1^0^0 + 100D^9^9N** (binomial theorem, N^2 = 0)

This gives:
```
J^1^0^0 = | 2^1^0^0   100*2^9^9   0   |
       |  0      2^1^0^0      0   |
       |  0       0      3^1^0^0  |

**Challenge:** Much more complex than diagonal case-requires Jordan form theory and careful computation of nilpotent contributions.

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up coordinates. The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega. Let's use theta as the angle measured from the bottom of the hoop.

Coordinate system:
- The hoop rotates about the z-axis (vertical)
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The bead is at position theta on the h","# Physics Assignment Solution: Rotating Hoop Problem

I'll walk you through this classic Lagrangian mechanics problem step by step.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Position of bead on rotating hoop (using center as origin):
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta (negative since theta = 0 is at bottom)

**Finding the kinetic energy:**

Taking derivatives:
- x_dot = R theta_dot cos theta cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R theta_dot cos theta sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R theta_dot sin theta

After computing x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2 (the cross terms cancel):

**T =  m[R^2theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2 sin^2 theta]**

**Potential energy:**

**U = mgz = -mgR cos theta**

**Lagrangian:**

**L = T - U =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2 theta + mgR cos theta**

**Equation of motion (Euler-Lagrange):**

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin theta cos theta - mgR sin theta

Applying d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0:

**theta_ddot = sin theta (omega^2 cos theta - g/R)**

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria (theta_ddot = 0):**

sin theta (omega^2 cos theta - g/R) = 0

This gives two cases:

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **omega^2 cos theta - g/R = 0** -> cos theta = g/(Romega^2)
   - Only exists when omega^2 >= g/R
   - Gives theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))

**Stability analysis:**

Define effective potential: U_eff = - mR^2omega^2 sin^2 theta - mgR cos theta

Check second derivative at equilibria:

d^2U_eff/dtheta^2 = -mR^2omega^2 cos(2theta) + mgR cos theta

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- d^2U_eff/dtheta^2 = mR(g - Romega^2)
- **Stable if omega < omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**
- **Unstable if omega > omega_c**

**At theta = pi (top):**
- d^2U_eff/dtheta^2 = -mR(Romega^2 + g) < 0
- **Always unstable**

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omega_c):
- These are **stable equilibria** (can verify by substitution)

**Critical angular velocity:**

**omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**

## Part (c): Physical Discussion

**Physical Meaning:**

- At low rotation rates (omega < omega_c), gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom
- At high rotation rates (omega > omega_c), centrifugal effects dominate, pushing the bead outward to a position away from the bottom
- At the critical speed, the bottom position becomes unstable

**Bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation** because:
- For omega < omega_c: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- For omega > omega_c: the stable equilibrium splits into two symmetric stable positions (+/-theta), while theta = 0 becomes unstable
- The number and stability of equilibria changes discontinuously at omega = omega_c

**Model limitations at high omega:**

1. **Air resistance** becomes significant
2. **Elastic deformation** of the hoop
3. **Bead may slip** despite ""frictionless"" assumption (can't maintain contact)
4. **Structural failure** of apparatus
5. **Quantum/relativistic effects** (at extreme speeds)

Let me set up the problem:

- Hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with constant angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- No friction

I should guide them through this step by step, explaining the concepts so they learn.

Par","Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me help you work through it step-by-step so you understand what's happening.

## Part (a): Setting up the Lagrangian

**Let's think about the coordinates first:**

The bead is constrained to the hoop, so theta is our only degree of freedom. But the hoop is rotating, so the bead's position in space involves both theta and the rotation.

**Position in Cartesian coordinates** (origin at hoop center, z-axis vertical):
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)  [negative because theta = 0 is at bottom]

**Now you find the velocities** by taking time derivatives. Try this yourself first - what do you get for x_dot, y_dot, and z_dot?

<details>
<summary>Solution for velocities:</summary>

x_dot = R theta_dot cos(theta) cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
y_dot = R theta_dot cos(theta) sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
z_dot = R theta_dot sin(theta)

</details>

**Kinetic Energy:**
When you compute x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2, the cross terms cancel (nice!), giving:

**T =  m[R^2theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2 sin^2(theta)]**

The first term is motion along the hoop, the second is from the rotation.

**Potential Energy:**
V = mgz = **-mgR cos(theta)**

**Therefore, the Lagrangian is:**

## L =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2(theta) + mgR cos(theta)

**Equation of motion** (apply Euler-Lagrange):

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot  
dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

This gives:

## **theta_ddot = omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - (g/R) sin(theta)**

or factoring:

## **theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R]**

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium positions

Set theta_ddot = 0:

**sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R] = 0**

This gives two cases:

**Case 1:** sin(theta) = 0  
-> **theta = 0** (bottom) or **theta = pi** (top)

**Case 2:** omega^2 cos(theta) = g/R  
-> **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)**

This only has solutions when g/(Romega^2) <= 1, meaning:

## **omegac = sqrt(g/R)** is the critical angular velocity

For omega > omegac, there are equilibrium positions at theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2)) on both sides of the hoop.

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium: theta = theta_0 +   (small  )

The equation becomes: ** _ddot ~= [omega^2cos(2theta_0) - (g/R)cos(theta_0)] **

Stable if this coefficient is **negative**.

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- Coefficient = omega^2 - g/R
- **omega < omegac**: STABLE  
- **omega > omegac**: UNSTABLE  

**At theta = pi (top):**
- Coefficient = omega^2 + g/R > 0
- Always **UNSTABLE**

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omegac):
- These are **STABLE** (you can verify this)

---

## Part (c): Physical meaning and bifurcation

**Physical Interpretation:**

When the hoop spins slowly (omega < omegac), the bead sits happily at the bottom - gravity wins.

When omega > omegac, centrifugal effects dominate. The bottom becomes unstable, and the bead moves outward to an equilibrium position where centrifugal force balances the component of gravity pulling it down.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

At omega = omegac, the system undergoes a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- One equilibrium (bottom) splits into three (bottom + two symmetric positions)
- The original equilibrium changes stability
- This is a qualitative change in system behavior at a critical parameter value

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **No friction**: At high speeds, air resistance becomes significant
2. **Rigid hoop**: The hoop might deform or vibrate
3. **Point mass**: The bead's finite size matters at extreme angles
4. **Perfect constraint**: The bead might slip or bounce off the hoop
5. **Classical mechanics**: At absurdly high omega, relativistic effects... (just kidding, but you get the idea!)

What are you working on?",0,1913,1913,2498,30.1,"Great! This is a linear algebra problem about eigenvalues, eigenspaces, and diagonalizability. Let me work through this step-by-step.

**Part (a): Find eigenvalues and algebraic multiplicities**

         | 0    2-lambda   1","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

Let me walk you through this problem step-by-step!

## Part (a): Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, there's a shortcut: the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries!

But let's verify with the characteristic polynomial:

det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                  | 0    2-lambda   1  |
                  | 0     0   3-lambda |

For a triangular matrix, the determinant is the product of diagonal entries:

**det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda) = 0**

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  0 |

This gives us: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**E_2 = span{[1, 0, 0]^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |

From row 2: v_3 = v_2  
From row 1: v_1 = v_2

**E_3 = span{[1, 1, 1]^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**NO!** Here's why:

For lambda = 2: algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1)

For diagonalizability, we need geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues. We also need 3 linearly independent eigenvectors for a 3*3 matrix, but we only have 2.

---

## Part (c): Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

### Geometric Interpretation:

A **diagonalizable matrix** transforms space by pure scaling along independent eigenvector directions (like stretching/compressing along axes).

A **non-diagonalizable matrix** has an additional ""shearing"" component. The deficiency in eigenvectors means some directions are inherently coupled-you can't decompose the transformation into completely independent scaling operations.

### Computing A^1^0^0:

**If A were diagonalizable:**
- A = PDP^-^1 where D is diagonal
- A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1
- D^1^0^0 is trivial (just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)  

**Since A is NOT diagonalizable:**
- Need **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1
- J has Jordan blocks like | 2  1 |  
                           | 0  2 |
- Computing J^1^0^0 requires binomial expansion for Jordan blocks
- Much more tedious! For a 2*2 Jordan block: J^n requires computing derivatives

**(a) Finding eigenvalues and algebraic multiplicities:**

So the eigenvalues are: 2, 2, and 3.

More formally, we find eigenvalues by solving det(A - lambdaI) = 0:

I'll walk you through each part!

## (a) Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

To verify, find det(A - lambdaI) = 0:

```
A - lambdaI = | 2-lambda   1    0  |
         |  0   2-lambda   1  |
         |  0    0   3-lambda |

det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda) = 0
```

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |
```

Row reducing gives: y = 0, z = 0, x is free

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |
```

This gives: x = y = z

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

### Is A diagonalizable? **NO**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the geometric multiplicity (1) != algebraic multiplicity (2). A matrix is diagonalizable iff geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for all eigenvalues. We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but need 3 for a 3*3 matrix.

## (c) Geometric Interpretation and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
A non-diagonalizable matrix can't be represented as pure scaling along independent axes. It contains a **shearing component** in addition to scaling. The transformation ""mixes"" certain directions together rather than acting independently on them.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For non-diagonalizable matrices, use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1. Write J = D + N where D is diagonal and N is nilpotent (N^2 = 0):

Using binomial theorem (since DN = ND):
**J^1^0^0 = D^1^0^0 + 100D^9^9N**

```
J^1^0^0 = | 2^1^0^0    100*2^9^9    0    |
       |  0       2^1^0^0       0    |
       |  0        0       3^1^0^0  |
```

**Challenges vs. diagonalizable matrices:**
1. Can't just raise diagonal entries to the power directly
2. Get **polynomial growth** (like 100*2^9^9) mixed with exponential terms
3. Must find Jordan form and basis P
4. More computational steps and theory required

Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it step by step.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- The bead is at angle theta from the bottom of the hoop
- Using the center of the hoop as origin with z-axis pointing up

**Position in Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**
After computing x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

$$T = \frac{m}{2}(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2) = \frac{mR^2}{2}[\thet ^2 + omega^2 \sin^2(theta)]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos(theta)$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{mR^2}{2}[\thet ^2 + omega^2 \sin^2(theta)] + mgR\cos(theta)}$$

**Equation of Motion:**
Using Euler-Lagrange equation: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{dL}{d\dot{theta}} - \frac{dL}{dtheta} = 0$

$$\boxed{\theta_ddot = \sin(theta)\left[\omega^2\cos(theta) - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set theta_ddot = 0):
$$\sin(theta)\left[\omega^2\cos(theta) - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

This gives:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top) - always exists
3. **theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))** - exists only when $omega >= \sqrt{g/R}$

**Stability Analysis:**
For small perturbations   around equilibrium theta_eq, the linearized equation is:
$$\ddot{ } = \left[\omega^2\cos(2theta_{eq}) - \frac{g}{R}\cos(theta_{eq})\right] $$

Stable if coefficient < 0, unstable if > 0.

**Results:**

| Equilibrium | Condition | Stability |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| theta = 0 (bottom) | Always exists | Stable if $omega < omega_c$<br>Unstable if $omega > omega_c$ |
| theta = pi (top) | Always exists | Always unstable |
| $theta = +/-\arccos\frac{g}{Romega^2}$ | $omega > omega_c$ | Stable |

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical meaning:**

At low rotation rates (omega < omega_c), gravity dominates and the bead sits at the bottom. As rotation increases, the centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) pushes the bead outward. At the **critical angular velocity** omega_c = sqrt(g/R), the bottom position becomes unstable.

For omega > omega_c, two new stable equilibria appear symmetrically above the bottom, where the centrifugal force and gravity balance. The bead rises to these positions where it rotates in a horizontal circle.

**Bifurcation:**

This is a **supercritical pitchfork bifurcation**:
- One stable equilibrium (theta = 0) exists for omega < omega_c
- At omega = omega_c, the equilibrium loses stability
- For omega > omega_c, this becomes unstable and *two* new stable equilibria branch off symmetrically

The system's qualitative behavior changes dramatically at the critical point!

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **No friction assumption**: At very high omega, the bead needs a normal force to maintain circular motion. If friction is too small, the bead might slip azimuthally on the hoop.

2. **Rigid hoop**: The hoop may deform or break due to centrifugal stress at high rotation rates.

3. **Air resistance**: Becomes significant at high speeds, dissipating energy.

4. **Point mass approximation**: The finite size of the bead matters at extreme positions.

5. **Mechanical integrity**: The mounting/bearings of the rotating hoop would fail.

$$f'(theta) = \frac{g^2}{R^2omega^2} - omega^2 < 0$$
- **These are stable!**

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical meaning:**
- At low omega: gravity dominates -> bead settles at bottom
- At high omega: centrifugal effect dominates -> bead flung outward to sides
- At omega = omega_c: transition point where bottom becomes unstable

**Why this is a bifurcation:**
This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For $omega < omega_c$: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- For $omega > omega_c$: bottom becomes unstable, two new stable equilibria appear symmetrically

The number and stability of equilibria change qualitatively at the bifurcation point!

**Model assumptions that break down at high omega:**
1. **Frictionless constraint** - at very high omega, the normal force becomes enormous; any imperfection causes heating
2. **Rigid hoop** - material deformation/failure at extreme centrifugal forces
3. **Point mass bead** - finite size effects, aerodynamic drag
4. **Perfect constraint** - bead might detach or bounce at high speeds
5. **Classical mechanics** - if somehow R or omega led to relativistic speeds (absurd but theoretically!)

The matrix is:

This is an upper triangular matrix.

(a) Finding eigenvalues:

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**Key insight**: Notice that A is an upper triangular matrix!

For triangular matrices, there's a shortcut: **the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries**.

But let's verify with the characteristic polynomial:
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda  1    0   |
                 | 0    2-lambda  1   |

Since it's triangular: det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = **(2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Answer**: 
- lambda = 2 with algebraic multiplicity 2
- lambda = 3 with algebraic multiplicity 1

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|

This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, and v_1 is free.

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|

This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3 (let's call it t)

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**NO!** Here's why:
- For eigenvalue lambda = 2: algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1)
- We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but need 3 for a 3*3 matrix to be diagonalizable

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
- Diagonalizable matrices represent transformations that can be understood by stretching/compressing along independent eigenvector directions
- Non-diagonalizable matrices have **shearing** components-they distort space in ways that can't be decomposed into pure stretches
- The ""defect"" happens because some eigenspaces are too small relative to the eigenvalue's multiplicity

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

*For diagonalizable matrices:* A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy-just raise diagonal entries to 100th power!)

*For non-diagonalizable matrices:* You need **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |

Then you compute J^1^0^0 using the formula for powers of Jordan blocks, which involves binomial coefficients and is messier.

**Challenge**: Jordan blocks like |2 1| raised to high powers create terms like n*2  in off-diagonal positions, requiring more complex calculations.

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |     Row reduce to:    | 0  1  0 |

This gives: x_2 = 0, x_3 = 0, x_1 is free

A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |     
         |  0 -1  1 |     gives: x_1 = x_2 = x_3
         |  0  0  0 |
```

**Eigenspace for lambda = 3:** span{(1, 1, 1)^T} - **dimension 1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO!**

**Justification:** For diagonalizability, geometric multiplicity must equal algebraic multiplicity for each eigenvalue.
- For lambda = 2: geometric mult. (1) != algebraic mult. (2)  
- We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors, but need 3 for a 3*3 matrix

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
When a matrix is non-diagonalizable, it means the transformation cannot be represented as pure scaling along independent directions. The matrix has a ""shearing"" component that can't be eliminated by changing basis. The eigenspace for lambda = 2 is ""deficient""-it doesn't have enough dimensions.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a *diagonalizable* matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

For A (non-diagonalizable), use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where

```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |  <- Jordan block for lambda=2
    | 0  0  3 |

Then J^1^0^0 = | 2^1^0^0   100*2^9^9    0   |
           |  0      2^1^0^0      0   |
           |  0       0      3^1^0^0 |

**Challenge:** The off-diagonal 1 in the Jordan block creates that 100*2^9^9 term, making computation more complex than just exponentiating diagonal entries.

Solving this system:

### Is A diagonalizable?

- For lambda = 2: geometric multiplicity (1) < algebraic multiplicity (2)

## Part (c): Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

### Geometric interpretation:

A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that can be completely described by stretching along independent directions (the eigenvectors). 

A **non-diagonalizable** matrix has a ""shearing"" component-it doesn't just stretch, it also shifts vectors in ways that can't be decomposed into pure stretches along fixed directions.

### Computing A^1^0^0:

**For diagonalizable matrices:** A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## (a) Finding eigenvalues and algebraic multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**!

To verify, find the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det | 2-lambda  1    0   |
                  | 0    2-lambda  1   |
                  | 0    0    3-lambda |
```

For a triangular matrix: det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = **(2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Finding eigenspaces and checking diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0
```
| 0  1  0 | | x |   | 0 |
| 0  0  1 | | y | = | 0 |
| 0  0  1 | | z |   | 0 |
```
This gives: y = 0, z = 0, x is free

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0
```
| -1  1  0 | | x |   | 0 |
|  0 -1  1 | | y | = | 0 |
|  0  0  0 | | z |   | 0 |
```
This gives: x = y = z (let them all equal t)

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO.**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but need 3 for diagonalizability.

## (c) Geometric meaning and computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
A non-diagonalizable matrix can't be represented as pure scaling along coordinate axes in any basis. It combines **scaling with shearing**. The eigenspace for lambda = 2 is ""deficient""-there aren't enough independent directions that get purely scaled.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

- **For diagonalizable matrices:** A = PDP^-^1 -> A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

- **For this non-diagonalizable matrix:** Use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where
```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

**Challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 is harder! You need to use J = D + N and apply the binomial theorem, where N is nilpotent. For a 2*2 Jordan block with eigenvalue lambda:

```
| lambda  1 |^1^0^0   | lambda^1^0^0   100lambda^9^9 |
| 0  lambda |    = | 0      lambda^1^0^0    |
```

So A^1^0^0 requires finding P, computing each Jordan block power, then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1.

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From the equations: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```

This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO!**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if the geometric multiplicity equals the algebraic multiplicity for every eigenvalue. We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for a 3*3 matrix.

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric Interpretation:**
- A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that can be understood as pure scaling along independent directions (the eigenvectors)
- A non-diagonalizable matrix has a ""shearing"" component-it stretches/scales in some directions but also mixes coordinates together
- For A, the repeated eigenvalue lambda = 2 creates a ""defective"" eigenspace-there aren't enough independent directions that get purely scaled, so the transformation includes shearing

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For diagonalizable matrices: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy-just raise diagonal entries to the 100th power!)

Since A is **NOT** diagonalizable, you need the **Jordan Normal Form**:

A = PJP^-^1 where J = | 2  1  0 |
                     | 0  2  0 |
                     | 0  0  3 |

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**The challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 is harder because of the 1 above the diagonal. You need the binomial formula:
```
J^1^0^0 = | 2^1^0^0   100*2^9^9    0   |
       | 0      2^1^0^0        0   |
       | 0      0         3^1^0^0  |
```

Much more complex than just raising diagonal entries to the 100th power!

Position of the bead:

Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let me use a fixed coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis). The bead's position:
- Distance from rotation axis: r = R sin theta
- Height: z = -R cos theta (taking origin at hoop center)
- Azimuthal angle: phi = omegat (hoop rotates)

**Finding the kinetic energy:**

The velocity has three components:
- Radial: r_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot
- Vertical: z_dot = R sin theta * theta_dot  
- Azimuthal: v_phi = romega = Romega sin theta

So:
$$T = \frac{1}{2}m(\dot{r}^2 + r^2\omega^2 + \dot{z}^2)$$

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m[R^2\cos^2\theta \cdot\dot{\theta}^2 + R^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta + R^2\sin^2\theta \cdot\dot{\theta}^2]$$

$$T = \frac{1}{2}mR^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta$$

**Potential energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$ -> $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top of hoop) - always exists  
3. **$\cos\theta = \frac{g}{R\omega^2}$** - exists only if $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize around each equilibrium point:

**Bottom (theta = 0):**
- For small theta: $\ddot{\theta} \approx \theta\left(\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}\right)$
- If $\omega < \omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$: **STABLE** (coefficient negative -> restoring force)
- If $\omega > \omega_c$: **UNSTABLE**

**Top (theta = pi):**
- Let theta = pi +  : $\ddot{\varepsilon} \approx \varepsilon\left(\omega^2 + \frac{g}{R}\right)$
- Always **UNSTABLE** (coefficient always positive)

**Tilted positions** $\theta_0 = \arccos(g/R\omega^2)$ when $\omega > \omega_c$:
- Linearization gives: $\ddot{\varepsilon} \approx -\omega^2\sin^2\theta_0 \cdot \varepsilon$
- **STABLE** - oscillations around this position

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**What's happening physically?**

- At low omega, gravity dominates -> bead sits at bottom
- As omega increases, centrifugal effect (in rotating frame) pushes bead outward
- At omega = omega_c, the bottom becomes unstable - this is a **bifurcation point**
- For omega > omega_c, two new stable equilibria appear at tilted angles

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**: as the control parameter (omega) passes through the critical value (omega_c), the number and stability of equilibria change qualitatively. One stable equilibrium becomes unstable, and two new stable equilibria ""branch off.""

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **No friction** - at very high omega, air resistance becomes significant
2. **Rigid hoop** - centrifugal forces could deform the hoop
3. **Point mass bead** - the bead's finite size matters if it moves very fast
4. **Perfect constraint** - bead might fly off or vibrate perpendicular to hoop
5. **Classical mechanics** - okay, probably not relevant here!

**Part (a): Derive the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- No friction

I need to find the kinetic energy T and potential energy V.

Coordinate system:
Let's use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (axis of ","Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it step by step.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let's place the origin at the center of the hoop with z-axis vertical (along rotation axis).

For a bead at angle theta from the bottom:
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Finding the kinetic energy:**

Taking derivatives:
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

Computing x_dot^2 + y_dot^2:
x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 = R^2cos^2(theta)theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2 sin^2(theta)

Therefore:
**T = (m/2)(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2) = (mR^2/2)[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]**

**Potential energy:**
**V = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)**

**Lagrangian:**
```
L = T - V = (mR^2/2)[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)] + mgR cos(theta)
```

**Euler-Lagrange equation:**

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta) cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot  ->  d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot

Setting them equal and simplifying:

```
theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R]
```

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

**Two cases:**

1. **sin(theta) = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** -> theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))  
   (Only exists when omega^2 >= g/R)

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium theta_0 by letting theta = theta_0 +  theta:

 theta_ddot ~= f'(theta_0) theta where f(theta) = sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R]

f'(theta) = omega^2 cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos(theta)

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- f'(0) = omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable if omega < omegac = sqrt(g/R)**
- **Unstable if omega > omegac**

**At theta = pi (top):**
- f'(pi) = omega^2 + g/R > 0
- **Always unstable**

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (exists only when omega > omegac):
- Can show f'(theta_0) = g^2/(R^2omega^2) - omega^2 < 0 (when omega > omegac)
- **Stable**

**Critical angular velocity:** 
```
omegac = sqrt(g/R)
```

## Part (c): Physical Meaning and Discussion

**Physical interpretation:**

- At **low rotation speeds** (omega < omegac): Gravity dominates, and the bead sits stably at the bottom
- At **high rotation speeds** (omega > omegac): Centrifugal effects dominate, pushing the bead outward to new stable positions away from the bottom

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omegac: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- At omega = omegac: bifurcation point where bottom becomes unstable  
- For omega > omegac: bottom becomes unstable, and **two new symmetric stable equilibria** appear at +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))

The system's qualitative behavior changes fundamentally at the critical point!

**Model breakdown at high omega:**

1. **Air resistance** becomes significant (drag   v^2)
2. **Bead might slip/fly off** the hoop
3. **Hoop deformation** under centrifugal stress
4. **Friction** (even small) affects dynamics
5. **Relativistic effects** (if omegaR approaches c... unlikely but technically!)

## Part (a): Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries!

**Eigenvalues:**
- lambda = 2 (appears twice on diagonal)
- lambda = 3 (appears once on diagonal)

**Algebraic multiplicities:**
- lambda = 2: multiplicity **2**

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{[1, 1, 1]^T}** -> dimension = **1**

## Part (c): Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizability:**

A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that simply stretches/compresses along independent directions (the eigenvectors). A non-diagonalizable matrix has a ""shearing"" component-it distorts space in a way that can't be decomposed into pure scaling along perpendicular axes.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

**If A were diagonalizable:** A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy-just raise diagonal entries to 100th power!)

**Since A is NOT diagonalizable:** Use **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J is the Jordan form
- J has a 2*2 Jordan block for lambda = 2

You'd need to compute J^1^0^0 using the formula for Jordan block powers, which is more complex than just exponentiating diagonal entries.

**Challenge:** Computing powers of Jordan blocks involves binomial coefficients and is computationally messier than the diagonal case.

## Part (c): Geometric Meaning and Computing A^100

**Geometric interpretation of non-diagonalizability:**

When a matrix is diagonalizable, it means you can find a basis of eigenvectors - directions that are only scaled (not rotated/sheared) by the transformation. 

When **non-diagonalizable**, some directions experience **shearing** in addition to scaling. The matrix ""mixes"" certain dimensions in a way that can't be separated into independent directions.

**Computing A^100:**

For a **diagonalizable** matrix: A = PDP^-^1
- Then A^100 = PD^100P^-^1 
- Computing D^100 is trivial (just raise diagonal entries to the 100th power)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices like this one:
- Use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where J is almost diagonal
- For this matrix: J = | 2  1  0 |
                        | 0  2  0 |
                        | 0  0  3 |
- Computing J^100 requires using the formula for powers of Jordan blocks (involves binomial coefficients)
- Much more computational work!

**Alternatively**, you could compute A^100 using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem or direct calculation, but both are tedious.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up the problem:**

Let me use a coordinate system with the z-axis vertical (along the rotation axis). The bead's position in the inertial frame is:
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)  [measuring from the center, negative since theta = 0 is at bottom]

**Finding velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic energy:**
T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After computing (the cross terms cancel!):
$$T = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2(\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta) + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial\theta} = 0$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$ -> $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial\theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria:** Set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top of hoop) - always exists  
3. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** - exists only if $\omega^2 \geq g/R$

**Stability analysis:**

For small perturbations theta = theta_0 +  , linearize to get:
$$\ddot{\eta} = \left[\frac{\partial\ddot{\theta}}{\partial\theta}\right]_{\theta_0} \eta$$

Computing the derivative:
$$\frac{\partial\ddot{\theta}}{\partial\theta} = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

**At theta = 0:**
$$\frac{\partial\ddot{\theta}}{\partial\theta}\bigg|_{\theta=0} = \omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$$

- **Stable** if $\omega^2 < g/R$ (derivative negative)
- **Unstable** if $\omega^2 > g/R$ (derivative positive)

**Critical angular velocity:** 
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi:**
$$\frac{\partial\ddot{\theta}}{\partial\theta}\bigg|_{\theta=\pi} = \omega^2 + \frac{g}{R} > 0$$

**Always unstable** (bead won't stay at top)

**At cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** (when omega > omegac):

These give **two symmetric equilibria** at theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2)). You can verify these are **stable** by substituting into the stability condition.

---

## Part (c): Physical Meaning and Bifurcation

**Physical interpretation:**

At **low rotation speeds** (omega < omegac):
- Gravity dominates
- The bead stays at the bottom (theta = 0)
- The centrifugal effect isn't strong enough to overcome gravity

At **high rotation speeds** (omega > omegac):
- The bottom becomes unstable
- Two new stable equilibria appear symmetrically on either side
- The bead ""climbs up"" the hoop to balance centrifugal force against gravitational restoring force

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- Below omegac: 1 stable equilibrium
- At omegac: bifurcation point (critical transition)
- Above omegac: 1 unstable equilibrium + 2 new stable equilibria

The system's qualitative behavior changes at the critical parameter value.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless motion** - air resistance becomes significant at high speeds
2. **Rigid hoop** - centrifugal forces could deform the hoop
3. **Point mass bead** - the bead's finite size matters in extreme rotation
4. **No slipping** - at extreme omega, the bead might lose contact or vibrate
5. **Perfect vertical axis** - wobbling/precession becomes more likely
6. **Classical mechanics** - probably not an issue unless omega is *really* extreme!

To ","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

I'll guide you through this problem step-by-step. Let me help you understand the concepts rather than just giving you answers!

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**Key insight**: Notice that A is an upper triangular matrix. What's special about triangular matrices?

For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**!

The characteristic polynomial is:
det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = **(2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Answer:**
- lambda = 2 with algebraic multiplicity 2
- lambda = 3 with algebraic multiplicity 1

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

(A - 2I) = | 0  1  0 |
           | 0  0  1 |
           | 0  0  1 |

From this system:
- Row 2 & 3: z = 0
- Row 1: y = 0  
- x is free

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> dimension = 1

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

(A - 3I) = | -1  1  0 |
           |  0 -1  1 |
           |  0  0  0 |

This gives us x = y = z

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> dimension = 1

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**No!** Here's why:
- For lambda = 2: algebraic multiplicity = 2, but geometric multiplicity = 1
- These must be equal for diagonalizability
- We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total (need 3)

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
A non-diagonalizable matrix can't be represented as pure scaling along independent directions. It has a ""shearing"" component that can't be separated from the scaling.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For diagonalizable B = PDP^-^1: simply compute B^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

For non-diagonalizable A, you'd need **Jordan Normal Form**:
A = PJP^-^1 where J is the Jordan form with Jordan blocks

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1, but computing J^1^0^0 is trickier-it involves binomial expansions for the nilpotent parts.

A - lambdaI = |","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## Part (a): Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, we have a nice shortcut: the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries!

To verify, find the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  |
                 | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

For upper triangular matrices: **det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |
```

Row reduce to get:
```
| 0  1  0 |     ->  v_2 = 0
| 0  0  1 |     ->  v_3 = 0
| 0  0  0 |     ->  v_1 is free
```

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |
```

This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

---

**Is A diagonalizable? NO!  **

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the geometric multiplicity (1) is less than the algebraic multiplicity (2). We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for diagonalizability.

---

## Part (c): Geometric Interpretation and Computing A^100

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
- A diagonalizable matrix simply scales vectors along eigendirections
- A non-diagonalizable matrix has **shearing** components in addition to scaling
- There's no basis where the transformation is ""purely diagonal"" - some directions get both scaled AND pushed in other directions

**Computing A^100:**

For diagonalizable matrices: A = PDP^-^1, so A^100 = PD^100P^-^1 (easy - just raise diagonal entries to 100th power!)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, we need **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J is the Jordan form
- Here: J = | 2  1  0 |
           | 0  2  0 |
           | 0  0  3 |

**The challenge:** Jordan blocks don't behave simply when raised to powers. You get:
```
| 2  1 |^100  =  | 2^100    100*2^99 |
| 0  2 |         | 0        2^100     |
```

The off-diagonal entries generate polynomial terms, making computation much more complex than just exponentiating diagonal entries!

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up coordinates. The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega. Let theta be the angle measured from the bottom of the hoop.

Coordinate system:
- Let's use a fixed coordinate system with z-axis vertical (along the rotation axis)
- The hoop has radius R
- theta is measured from t","# Physics Assignment Solution: Bead on Rotating Hoop

I'll walk you through this problem step-by-step!

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- theta = angle from bottom of hoop
- Hoop rotates about vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- Bead position at radius R from center

**Position in Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Calculating velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**
After computing x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m[\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2] = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$U = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Applying Euler-Lagrange equation:**

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

**Equation of motion:**
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set theta_ddot = 0):

$$\sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

This gives us:

1. **sin(theta) = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** -> This requires |g/(Romega^2)| <= 1

   Therefore: **New equilibria exist only when** omega >= sqrt(g/R)

**Stability analysis:**

For small perturbations around equilibrium theta_0, linearize:
$$\ddot{\theta} \approx f'(\theta_0)\theta$$

where stability requires f'(theta_0) < 0.

Computing: $$f'(\theta) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$f'(0) = \omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$$

- **Stable if** omega^2 < g/R  
- **Unstable if** omega^2 > g/R
- $$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$f'(\pi) = \omega^2 + \frac{g}{R} > 0$$ 
**Always unstable**  

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omegac):

After substitution and simplification:
$$f'(\theta_0) = \frac{g^2 - R^2\omega^4}{R^2\omega^2} < 0$$ for omega > omegac

**Stable!**  

**Summary:**
- **omega < omegac**: Only bottom stable
- **omega = omegac**: Bifurcation point  
- **omega > omegac**: Bottom unstable, two new stable equilibria at theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))

## Part (c): Physical Meaning and Bifurcation

**Physical interpretation:**

When the hoop spins slowly (omega < omegac), gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom. As rotation increases past the critical value, the centrifugal effect overpowers gravity, pushing the bead outward to a new equilibrium position away from the vertical axis.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. At omega = omegac:
- The system undergoes a qualitative change in behavior
- One stable equilibrium (bottom) becomes unstable
- Two new stable equilibria simultaneously appear
- The number of equilibrium solutions ""branches"" at the critical parameter value

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless motion** - Air resistance and bearing friction become significant at high speeds

2. **Rigid hoop** - Centrifugal forces could deform or even break the hoop material

3. **Constant omega** - Maintaining constant rotation requires continuous torque input; bead motion could affect rotation

4. **Point mass approximation** - At very high omega, the bead's finite size and rotational inertia matter

5. **Classical mechanics** - Extreme speeds might require relativistic corrections (though unlikely in practice!)

This is a legitimate homework help request, and I should help the student understand the concepts and work through the problem, not just give them answers to copy.

Let me work through this systematically, explaining the reasoning at each step.

**Part (a): Setting up the Lagrangian**

First, I need to establish a coordinate system and find the kinetic and potential energies.

Coordinate system:
- Let the hoop rotate ","Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through the approach and key concepts.

## Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Hoop rotates about vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- Bead position: angle theta from bottom of hoop
- In the lab frame, the bead has position:
  - x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
  - y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
  - z = -R cos theta (taking center as origin, z points up)

**Finding velocities:**
Take time derivatives and compute v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2

After some algebra (try this yourself!), you should get:
**v^2 = R^2theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2 sin^2theta**

**Kinetic Energy:**
T =  m(R^2theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2 sin^2theta)

**Potential Energy:**
V = mgz = -mgR cos theta

**Lagrangian:**
**L =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2theta + mgR cos theta**

**Equation of motion** (apply Euler-Lagrange equation):

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot  ->  d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin theta cos theta - mgR sin theta

Therefore:
**theta_ddot = omega^2 sin theta cos theta - (g/R) sin theta = sin theta[omega^2 cos theta - g/R]**

## Part (b): Equilibrium and Stability

**Equilibrium positions** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

sin theta[omega^2 cos theta - g/R] = 0

This gives:
1. **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop)
2. **theta = pi** (top of hoop)
3. **cos theta = g/(Romega^2)** (only exists if omega^2 >= g/R)

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium: theta = theta_0 +   (small  )

The linearized equation is: ** _ddot = [omega^2 cos(2theta_0) - (g/R)cos theta_0] **

Stable if coefficient < 0; unstable if > 0.

- **theta = 0 (bottom):** 
  - Coefficient = omega^2 - g/R
  - Stable if omega < sqrt(g/R)
  - Unstable if omega > sqrt(g/R)
  - **Critical frequency: omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

- **theta = pi (top):** 
  - Coefficient = omega^2 + g/R > 0
  - Always unstable

- **theta = arccos(g/Romega^2)** (exists when omega > omegac):
  - These are **stable** (you can verify this)

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical meaning:**
- At low omega: gravity dominates -> bead sits at bottom
- At high omega: centrifugal effect dominates -> bead pushed outward to new equilibrium positions
- At omegac = sqrt(g/R): the bottom position transitions from stable to unstable

**Bifurcation:**
This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. At omega = omegac, one stable equilibrium (bottom) becomes unstable and two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically. The system ""chooses"" one of the new equilibrium positions.

**Model breakdown at high omega:**
- Air resistance becomes significant
- Hoop may deform or material stress limits exceeded
- Bead might slip or have actual friction
- Relativistic effects (just kidding!  )
- Vibrations/oscillations of the hoop itself

- The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The bead position is constrained to the hoop

**Position of the bead:**
Let me use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis).

In cylindrical coo","# Physics Assignment Solution - Rotating Hoop Problem

Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it.

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let me use an inertial frame with the vertical (rotation axis) as the z-axis. The bead's position is:
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta (negative because theta = 0 at bottom)

**Finding velocities:**
- x_dot = R theta_dot cos theta cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R theta_dot cos theta sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R theta_dot sin theta

**Kinetic Energy:**

T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and simplifying (the cross terms cancel):

**T =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2 theta]**

**Potential Energy:**

V = mgz = -mgR cos theta

**Lagrangian:**

$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$
- $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

Therefore:

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

**Equilibrium positions** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

Setting $\sin\theta[\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R] = 0$:

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **omega^2cos theta = g/R** -> $\cos\theta = \frac{g}{R\omega^2}$

   This requires $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$ to have a physical solution

**Stability Analysis:**

For small perturbations   around equilibrium:
$$\ddot{\eta} \approx f'(\theta_{eq})\eta$$

where $f'(\theta) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$f'(0) = \omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$$

- If $\omega < \omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$: f'(0) < 0 -> **STABLE**
- If $\omega > \omega_c$: f'(0) > 0 -> **UNSTABLE**

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$f'(\pi) = \omega^2 + \frac{g}{R} > 0$$ -> always **UNSTABLE**

**At $\cos\theta_{eq} = g/(R\omega^2)$** (when omega > omega_c):

After substitution: $f'(\theta_{eq}) = \frac{g^2}{R^2\omega^2} - \omega^2 < 0$ -> **STABLE**

## **(c) Physical Interpretation**

**Bifurcation Behavior:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. At the critical value omega_c:

- **omega < omega_c**: Only one stable equilibrium at theta = 0 (bottom). The centrifugal effect is too weak to overcome gravity.

- **omega > omega_c**: The bottom becomes unstable, and **two new stable equilibria** appear symmetrically at $\theta_{eq} = \arccos(g/(R\omega^2))$. The bead is ""flung out"" by centrifugal effects.

**Physical meaning:** At low rotation rates, gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom. As omega increases past omega_c, the ""centrifugal force"" (in the rotating frame) overcomes the radial component of gravity, and the bead finds a new equilibrium at an angle.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless constraint**: At very high omega, even tiny friction could cause heating or the bead to slip
2. **Rigid hoop**: The hoop might deform or break under centrifugal stress
3. **Point mass**: The bead's finite size might matter
4. **Perfect constraint**: The bead might actually fly off the hoop
5. **Classical mechanics**: At extreme speeds, relativistic effects could appear (though this would be astronomical omega!)

- The hoop rotate","Great problem! This is a classic example in analytical mechanics. Let me walk you through it step-by-step.

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

### Setting up coordinates:

For a bead at angle theta from the bottom:
- **Height**: z = -R cos(theta)

**L = T - U =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2(theta) + mgR cos(theta)**

### Equation of motion:

Using Euler-Lagrange equation: d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot -> d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

Therefore:

**theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R]**

---

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

### Finding equilibria:

Set theta_ddot = 0:

sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

**Solution 1:** sin(theta) = 0 -> **theta = 0** (bottom) or **theta = pi** (top)

**Solution 2:** cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)

This requires |g/(Romega^2)| <= 1, so **omega >= sqrt(g/R)** for these equilibria to exist.

### Stability analysis:

Linearize around equilibrium theta_0 by setting theta = theta_0 +  :

The ""effective force"" is f(theta) = sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R]

Taking derivative: f'(theta) = omega^2 cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos(theta)

Stable if f'(theta_0) < 0, unstable if f'(theta_0) > 0.

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- f'(0) = omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable when omega < sqrt(g/R)**
- **Unstable when omega > sqrt(g/R)**
- **Critical angular velocity: omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

**At theta = pi (top):**
- f'(pi) = omega^2 + g/R > 0
- **Always unstable**

**At cos(theta_0) = g/(Romega^2)** (exists only for omega > omegac):
- f'(theta_0) = g^2/(R^2omega^2) - omega^2 < 0 (when omega > omegac)
- **These are stable**

---

## **(c) Physical Interpretation**

### What's happening physically:

The bead experiences two ""forces"" in the rotating frame:
1. **Gravity** pulling it down (favors theta = 0)
2. **Centrifugal effect** pushing it outward (favors theta = 90 )

At low omega, gravity wins -> bead stays at bottom.
At high omega, centrifugal effect wins -> bead moves to new equilibrium position.

### Bifurcation:

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omegac: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- At omega = omegac: bifurcation point (critical transition)
- For omega > omegac: three equilibria (unstable at theta = 0, two new stable ones at +/-theta_0)

The system topology changes qualitatively at the critical point!

### Breakdown of assumptions at high omega:

1. **Air resistance** becomes significant (drag   v^2)
2. **Friction** (assumed zero) would generate heat
3. **Material stress**: hoop and bead may deform or break
4. **Relativity**: at extremely high omega, speeds approach c
5. **Quantum effects**: bead position becomes uncertain at extreme scales

I'll use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (pointing up) and the hoop rotates about t","Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it step by step.

---

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Let theta be measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The hoop rotates about the vertical (z-axis) with angular velocity omega
- The bead position in cylindrical coordinates:
  - Vertical: z = -R cos(theta) (from center of hoop)
  - Radial distance from axis: r = R sin(theta)
  - Azimuthal: phi = omegat

**Finding the kinetic energy:**
The bead's velocity has two components:
- Motion along the hoop: contributes R^2theta_dot^2
- Being carried around by rotation: at radius R sin(theta), contributes (Romega sin theta)^2

In Cartesian coordinates, after working through the derivatives:
$$\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2 = R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta]$$

So: **T =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2theta]**

**Potential energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Applying Euler-Lagrange equation:**
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$$
$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

**Equation of motion:**
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

---

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):
$$\sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

This gives:

1. **sin theta = 0** -> **theta = 0** (bottom) or **theta = pi** (top)

2. **cos theta = g/(Romega^2)** -> exists only if **omega >= omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**
   - Gives **theta = +/- arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (two symmetric positions on the sides)

**Stability analysis:**
Linearize around equilibrium theta_0 by letting theta = theta_0 +  :

$$\ddot{\eta} \approx \left[\cos\theta_0\left(\omega^2\cos\theta_0 - \frac{g}{R}\right) - \omega^2\sin^2\theta_0\right]\eta$$

**For theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$\ddot{\eta} = \left(\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}\right)\eta$$

- If **omega < omega_c**: coefficient is negative -> **STABLE**  
- If **omega > omega_c**: coefficient is positive -> **UNSTABLE**  

**Critical angular velocity:** $$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**For theta = pi (top):**
$$\ddot{\eta} = \left(\omega^2 + \frac{g}{R}\right)\eta > 0$$
Always **UNSTABLE**  

**For theta = +/- arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omega_c):
$$\ddot{\eta} = -\omega^2\left[1 - \frac{g^2}{R^2\omega^4}\right]\eta = -\frac{\omega^4R^2 - g^2}{R^2\omega^2}\eta < 0$$
**STABLE**  

---

## **(c) Physical Interpretation**

**Physical meaning:**
- At low omega: gravity dominates, and the bead sits at the bottom
- At high omega: centrifugal effects dominate. The bottom becomes unstable because the bead ""wants"" to move outward (larger radius from rotation axis)
- Above omega_c, two new stable equilibria appear on the sides where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance

**Why this is a bifurcation:**
This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. At omega = omega_c:
- One stable equilibrium (bottom) becomes unstable
- Two new stable equilibria spontaneously appear
- The system ""breaks symmetry"" - the bead must choose left or right

This is spontaneous symmetry breaking - even though the system is symmetric, the bead picks a side!

**Breakdown of idealized assumptions at high omega:**
1. **Frictionless constraint fails**: At extremely high omega, the normal force becomes huge; even tiny friction causes heating
2. **Rigid body approximation**: The hoop may deform or vibrate
3. **Point mass approximation**: The bead has finite size; at high speeds this matters
4. **Classical mechanics**: At absurdly high speeds, relativistic effects could appear
5. **The constraint itself**: The bead might lose contact or the system might fly apart!

**Part (a): Derive the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up a coordinate system. The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega. Let's use theta as the angle measured from the bottom of the hoop.

Position of the bead:
If the hoop rotates about the vertical (z) axis, and theta is measured from the bottom, I can write the position in cylind","# Physics Assignment Solutions - Rotating Hoop Problem

I'll walk you through this classic problem step by step!

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- The hoop rotates about the vertical (z) axis with angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- Position of the bead:
  - x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
  - y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
  - z = -R cos(theta) (taking hoop center as reference)

**Finding velocities:**
Taking time derivatives:
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**
$$T = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2)$$

After expanding and using trig identities:
$$T = \frac{m}{2}R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{m}{2}R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**
Using Euler-Lagrange: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$):
$$\sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

This gives two cases:

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **omega^2 cos theta = g/R** -> $\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{g}{R\omega^2}\right)$
   - Only exists when $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$

**Stability Analysis:**
Linearize around equilibrium by examining:
$$f'(\theta_0) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

Stable if f'(theta_0) < 0.

| Equilibrium | f'(theta_0) | Stability |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **theta = 0** (bottom) | $\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$ | Stable if omega < omegac; Unstable if omega > omegac |
| **theta = pi** (top) | $\omega^2 + \frac{g}{R}$ | Always unstable |
| **theta = arccos(g/Romega^2)** | $< 0$ | Stable (when it exists) |

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical meaning:**
- **Low rotation (omega < omegac):** The bead stays at the bottom. Centrifugal effects are weak compared to gravity.
- **High rotation (omega > omegac):** The bottom becomes unstable! The bead moves to a tilted position where centrifugal force (outward) balances the component of gravity pulling it down.
- **At omega = omegac:** Transition point where the bottom position loses stability.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**
A bifurcation occurs when a small change in a parameter causes a qualitative change in system behavior. Here:
- For omega < omegac: one stable equilibrium (bottom)
- For omega > omegac: three equilibria (unstable bottom + two stable tilted positions)

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation** - the stable equilibrium ""splits"" into two new stable branches.

**Assumptions that break down at very high omega:**
1. **Rigid hoop assumption:** At extreme omega, centrifugal forces could deform or break the hoop
2. **Frictionless motion:** Air resistance becomes significant at high speeds
3. **Point mass bead:** The finite size of the bead matters at high speeds
4. **No slipping:** At very high omega, the bead might lose contact with the hoop or slip
5. **Classical mechanics:** At extreme energies, relativistic effects could appear (though this is very unrealistic for this setup!)

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

Notice that **A is upper triangular**. This is great news because:

> **Key fact**: For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are exactly the diagonal entries!

So the eigenvalues are:
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces & Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:**

Find the nullspace of (A - 2I):

```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |
```

Solving (A - 2I)v = 0:
- Row 2 or 3: v_3 = 0
- Row 1: v_2 = 0
- v_1 is free

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> dimension = **1**

**For lambda = 3:**

```
A - 3I = | -1  1   0 |
         |  0  -1  1 |
         |  0   0  0 |
```

Solving (A - 3I)v = 0:
- Row 2: v_3 = v_2
- Row 1: v_1 = v_2

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> dimension = **1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**No!** Here's why:

| Eigenvalue | Algebraic Multiplicity | Geometric Multiplicity |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| lambda = 2 | 2 | 1   |
| lambda = 3 | 1 | 1   |

For diagonalizability, we need geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues. Since this fails for lambda = 2, **A is not diagonalizable**.

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**

A non-diagonalizable matrix means you **cannot find a basis of eigenvectors** for R . Geometrically, the transformation has a ""shearing"" component in addition to scaling. The eigenspace for lambda = 2 is only 1-dimensional, but lambda = 2 ""wants"" to act on a 2-dimensional space-this creates a defect.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a **diagonalizable** matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices, use the **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenge**: Computing J^1^0^0 requires the **binomial expansion** for Jordan blocks:
```
| lambda  1 |    = | lambda     nlambda ^-^1 |
| 0  lambda |       | 0     lambda     |
```

This is more complex than just raising diagonal entries to the 100th power!

Position of the bead in a coordinate system:

- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The bead is at radi","# Physics Assignment Solution: Rotating Hoop Problem

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let theta be the angle from the bottom of the hoop. The hoop rotates about the vertical z-axis with angular velocity omega.

Position of the bead in Cartesian coordinates:
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)  [negative since theta = 0 is at bottom]

**Kinetic Energy:**

Taking time derivatives and computing v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 = R^2cos^2(theta)theta_dot^2 + R^2sin^2(theta)omega^2

z_dot^2 = R^2sin^2(theta)theta_dot^2

Therefore:
$$T = \frac{1}{2}m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2) = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{theta}^2 + omega^2\sin^2theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{theta}^2 + omega^2\sin^2theta] + mgR\cos theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange: $\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dL}{d\dot{theta}}\right) - \frac{dL}{dtheta} = 0$

- $\frac{dL}{d\dot{theta}} = mR^2\dot{theta}$
- $\frac{dL}{dtheta} = mR^2omega^2\sin theta \cos theta - mgR\sin theta$

This gives:
$$\boxed{\ddot{theta} = \sin theta\left[omega^2\cos theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

$$\sin theta\left[omega^2\cos theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

**Solution 1:** sin theta = 0  
-> **theta = 0** (bottom) or **theta = pi** (top)

**Solution 2:** $\cos theta = \frac{g}{Romega^2}$  
This requires $\left|\frac{g}{Romega^2}\right| \leq 1$, meaning $omega >= \sqrt{g/R}$

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium theta_0: let theta = theta_0 +  theta (small perturbation)

The linearized equation gives: $\ddot{ theta} = \left[omega^2\cos(2theta_0) - \frac{g}{R}\cos theta_0\right] theta$

Stable if coefficient < 0 (restoring force).

**For theta = 0 (bottom):**

- **omega < omega_c:** Stable  
- **omega > omega_c:** Unstable  

**For theta = pi (top):**
- Coefficient = $omega^2 + \frac{g}{R} > 0$
- Always **unstable**  

**For theta = arccos(g/Romega^2)** (when omega > omega_c):
- Two symmetric positions (+/-theta from vertical)
- Both are **stable**  

---

## Part (c): Physical Discussion

**Bifurcation Phenomenon:**

This is a classic example of a **pitchfork bifurcation**:

- **omega < omega_c:** One stable equilibrium at the bottom. The bead sits at the lowest point despite rotation.

- **omega = omega_c:** Bifurcation point where the bottom equilibrium transitions from stable to unstable.

- **omega > omega_c:** The bottom becomes unstable, and two new symmetric stable equilibria appear at elevated positions. The centrifugal effect overcomes gravity.

**Physical interpretation:** At low rotation rates, gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom. At high rotation rates, the centrifugal effect pushes the bead outward to elevated positions where these competing effects balance.

**Assumptions that break down at very high omega:**

1. **No friction/air resistance:** At high speeds, air drag becomes significant
2. **Rigid hoop:** Centrifugal forces may deform or break the hoop
3. **Bead remains on hoop:** The normal force could become insufficient; the bead might slip off
4. **Point mass approximation:** The finite size of the bead matters at extreme positions
5. **Constant omega:** Maintaining perfectly constant angular velocity becomes difficult

(a) Finding eigenvalues:

Algebraic","# Linear Algebra Help - Eigenvalues and Diagonalization

Great problem! Let me guide you through each part. I'll explain the concepts so you understand what's happening.

## Part (a): Finding Eigenvalues

**Key insight:** Notice that A is an upper triangular matrix (all entries below the diagonal are zero).

**Important property:** For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries!

So the eigenvalues are:
- **lambda = 2** (appears twice on the diagonal) -> algebraic multiplicity = 2
- **lambda = 3** (appears once) -> algebraic multiplicity = 1

You can verify this by computing det(A - lambdaI) = 0 if you want to show your work formally.

## Part (b): Finding Eigenspaces

For each eigenvalue, solve **(A - lambdaI)v = 0**:

**For lambda = 2:**
Set up (A - 2I):
```
| 0  1  0 |
| 0  0  1 |
| 0  0  1 |
```

What does this system tell you? Try solving it:
- Row 2 and 3 give: v_3 = 0
- Row 1 gives: v_2 = 0
- v_1 is free!

So the eigenspace is: **span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> geometric multiplicity = 1

**For lambda = 3:**
Try setting up (A - 3I) and solving. You should get eigenspace: **span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> geometric multiplicity = 1

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**No!** Here's why: A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues.

For lambda = 2: algebraic mult. (2) != geometric mult. (1)  

Since this condition fails, A is NOT diagonalizable.

## Part (c): Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
A non-diagonalizable matrix means there aren't enough linearly independent eigenvectors to form a basis. Geometrically, the transformation ""shears"" space in a way that can't be represented as pure scaling along independent directions.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**
- **If diagonalizable:** A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)
- **Since non-diagonalizable:** Must use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where J has eigenvalues on diagonal plus some 1's above. Computing J^1^0^0 is more complex with binomial expansions.

$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**

$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**

Applying Euler-Lagrange equation:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$ -> $\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}}\right) = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta[\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R]}$$

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta[\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R] = 0$$

This gives us:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top of hoop) - always exists  
3. **theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))** - exists only when $\omega^2 \geq g/R$

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium theta_0: let theta = theta_0 +   (  small)

$$\ddot{\eta} \approx \left[\omega^2\cos(2\theta_0) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta_0\right]\eta$$

Stable if coefficient < 0, unstable if > 0.

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$\ddot{\eta} = \left[\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}\right]\eta$$

- **Stable** when $\omega < \omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$
- **Unstable** when $\omega > \omega_c$

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$\ddot{\eta} = \left[\omega^2 + \frac{g}{R}\right]\eta > 0$$

- **Always unstable**

**At theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omegac):
After substitution and simplification:
$$\ddot{\eta} = \left[\frac{g^2}{R^2\omega^2} - \omega^2\right]\eta < 0$$

- **Stable** (these are the ""raised"" equilibrium positions)

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical Meaning:**

This system exhibits a **pitchfork bifurcation**:

- **omega < omegac:** Only the bottom position is stable. Gravity dominates, keeping the bead at the lowest point.

- **omega = omegac:** Critical point - the bottom equilibrium loses stability.

- **omega > omegac:** The centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) dominates. The bottom becomes unstable, and two new symmetric stable equilibria appear at elevated positions where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance.

**Why it's a bifurcation:**

At omegac, the system undergoes a qualitative change in its equilibrium structure - one stable equilibrium -> one unstable + two new stable equilibria. This is a classic supercritical pitchfork bifurcation.

**Breakdown of assumptions at high omega:**

1. **Structural integrity:** The hoop may deform or break under centrifugal stress
2. **Friction-free assumption:** At high speeds, air resistance becomes significant
3. **Rigid body assumption:** The hoop/support may vibrate or wobble
4. **Small bead approximation:** We treated the bead as a point mass
5. **Perfect circular geometry:** Manufacturing imperfections matter at extreme speeds

Let me work through this systematically.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- theta = angle measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- The bead is constrained to move on the hoop

**Position of the bead:**
Let me use a coordinate system where the vertical diameter is the z-axis.

In the rotating frame's perspective","# Physics Assignment - Lagrangian Mechanics Solution

Great problem! This is a classic example of symmetry breaking. Let me walk you through it.

## (a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up the problem:**

Let's use a lab frame with the z-axis along the vertical diameter. The bead's position is:
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = R(1 - cos theta)

where theta = 0 at the bottom of the hoop.

**Finding velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot * cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta * sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot * sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta * cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin theta * theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**

T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and using trig identities (cos^2(omegat) + sin^2(omegat) = 1):

**T =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2theta]**

**Potential Energy:**

V = mgz = **mgR(1 - cos theta)**

**Lagrangian:**

**L =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2theta] - mgR(1 - cos theta)**

**Equation of Motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange: d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin theta cos theta - mgR sin theta

Therefore:

**theta_ddot = sin theta(omega^2 cos theta - g/R)**

---

## (b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

sin theta(omega^2 cos theta - g/R) = 0

**Two cases:**

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **omega^2 cos theta - g/R = 0** -> cos theta = g/(Romega^2)
   
   This requires g/(Romega^2) <= 1, i.e., **omega >= sqrt(g/R)**
   
   When this condition is met: **theta_eq = arccos(g/(Romega^2))**

**Stability Analysis:**

For small perturbation theta = theta_eq +  :

 _ddot ~= [dtheta_ddot/dtheta]|_{theta_eq} *  

where dtheta_ddot/dtheta = omega^2 cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos theta

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- dtheta_ddot/dtheta|_0 = omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable if** omega^2 < g/R (negative -> restoring)
- **Unstable if** omega^2 > g/R

**Critical angular velocity: omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**

**At theta = pi (top):**
- dtheta_ddot/dtheta|_pi = -omega^2 + g/R < 0 (always negative for omega > 0)
- **Always unstable**

**At theta_eq = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (exists only when omega > omega_c):
- Substituting and simplifying gives a negative derivative
- **Stable equilibrium** (appears in symmetric pairs +/-theta_eq)

**Summary:**
- omega < omega_c: Only theta = 0 is stable
- omega = omega_c: Bifurcation point
- omega > omega_c: theta = 0 becomes unstable; two new stable equilibria appear at +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))

---

## (c) Physical Interpretation

**Physical Meaning:**

At low rotation rates, gravity dominates and the bead sits at the bottom. As omega increases, the centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) creates an outward ""force"" proportional to the distance from the rotation axis (R sin theta). 

At **omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**, the centrifugal effect at the bottom exactly balances the gravitational restoring force. Above this critical speed, the bottom becomes unstable, and the bead moves to a new equilibrium position where it's ""flung out"" to the side.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation** because:
- A single stable equilibrium (theta = 0) loses stability at a critical parameter value (omega = omega_c)
- Simultaneously, two new symmetric stable equilibria emerge (+/-theta_eq)
- The system ""breaks symmetry"" by choosing one of the two equivalent positions

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless constraint**: Air resistance becomes significant at high speeds
2. **Rigid hoop**: Centrifugal forces could deform the hoop
3. **Point mass**: The bead's finite size matters at extreme positions
4. **Perfect constraint**: The bead might fly off or lose contact with the hoop
5. **Non-relativistic mechanics**: At extraordinarily high omega (unrealistic here, but theoretically)

For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries!

So what are the diagonal entries of A? Count how many times each appears.
</details>

**You should find:** Two distinct eigenvalues. Write them down with their algebraic multiplicities.

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For your first eigenvalue (the one that appears twice):**
- Set up the system (A - lambdaI)v = 0
- Row reduce or solve directly
- What vectors v satisfy this?

**Key question:** How many linearly independent eigenvectors did you find for this eigenvalue? Compare this (geometric multiplicity) to how many times it appears as a root (algebraic multiplicity).

**For diagonalizability:** A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if **geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity** for every eigenvalue.

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^100

**Geometric meaning:** When a matrix is non-diagonalizable, it means there aren't enough eigenvectors to form a basis. The transformation has some ""shearing"" that can't be separated into pure scaling along independent directions.

**Computing A^100:**
- If A were diagonalizable: A = PDP^-^1, so A^100 = PD^100P^-^1 (easy!)
- Since it's not, you'd need **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where J has eigenvalues on diagonal but also some 1's above the diagonal
- This is more complex because you need generalized eigenvectors

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**!

**Characteristic polynomial:**
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  |
                 | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

For triangular matrices: det = product of diagonal entries

**det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces and Checking Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From the equations: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

---

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```

This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

---

**Is A diagonalizable? NO!  **

**Justification:** For diagonalizability, we need geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues.

- For lambda = 2: alg. mult. = 2, but geom. mult. = 1  
- For lambda = 3: alg. mult. = 1, geom. mult. = 1  

Since we only have **2 linearly independent eigenvectors** (need 3 for a 3*3 matrix), **A is not diagonalizable**.

---

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizability:**

A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that can be completely understood as scaling along perpendicular directions (eigenvectors). 

When a matrix is **non-diagonalizable**, the transformation includes a **""shearing"" component** that can't be separated into pure scaling. The deficiency in eigenvectors means the transformation ""mixes"" coordinates in a way that can't be decoupled.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

Two approaches:

**Method 1: Jordan Normal Form**
- Find A = PJP^-^1 where J is the Jordan form:
  ```
  J = | 2  1  0 |
      | 0  2  0 |
      | 0  0  3 |
  ```
- Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenges:**
- Computing J^1^0^0 requires the formula for Jordan block powers:
  ```
  | lambda  1 |    | lambda    nlambda ^-^1 |
  | 0  lambda |  = | 0      lambda    |
  ```
- Must find generalized eigenvectors (harder than regular eigenvectors)
- More computation than if A = PDP^-^1 with D diagonal (where D^1^0^0 is trivial)

**Method 2: Direct computation** (for small powers) or **Cayley-Hamilton theorem**

For diagonalizable matrices, A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 where D^1^0^0 is just each diagonal entry raised to the 100th power-much simpler!

## Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Place origin at hoop center, z-axis vertical (rotation axis)
- Bead position with theta from bottom of hoop

- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Find the velocities** (taking time derivatives):
- x_dot = R cos(theta)theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta)theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)

**Lagrangian:**
**L =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2sin^2(theta)] + mgR cos(theta)**

**Applying Euler-Lagrange equation:**
- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

**Equation of motion:**
**theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R]**

## Part (b): Equilibrium and Stability

**Equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0):

sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

**Solutions:**

1. **theta = 0** (bottom) - exists for all omega
2. **theta = pi** (top) - exists for all omega  
3. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** - only exists when **omega >= omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

**Stability analysis** (linearize around equilibria):

The effective ""spring constant"" is:
k(theta_0) = [omega^2cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos(theta)]|theta=theta_0

- **At theta = 0:** k = omega^2 - g/R
  - Stable if omega < omegac
  - Unstable if omega > omegac
  - **Critical value: omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

- **At theta = pi:** k = omega^2 + g/R > 0 -> **always unstable**

- **At cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2):** (for omega > omegac)
  - Can show k < 0 -> **stable**

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

- At **low omega**: Gravity wins -> bead stays at bottom

- At **omega = omegac**: Transition point!

**Bifurcation:**

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up a coordinate system. The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega. Let's use theta as the angle from the bottom of the hoop.

The position of the bead in cylindrical coordinates (or Cartesian):
- The bead is at angle theta from the bottom of the hoop
- The hoop rotates with an","Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me guide you through each part.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Let theta be the angle from the bottom of the hoop
- The hoop rotates about the vertical (z-axis) with angular velocity omega
- The bead's position at angle theta is at distance R sin(theta) from the rotation axis

**Finding the kinetic energy:**

The bead has two velocity components:
1. Motion along the hoop: contributes R^2theta_dot^2
2. Circular motion from rotation: the bead moves in a circle of radius R sin(theta), giving velocity omega R sin(theta)

So: **T = (m/2)R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]**

**Finding the potential energy:**

Taking the center of the hoop as the reference point:
**V = -mgR cos(theta)**

**The Lagrangian is:**
```
L = T - V = (m/2)R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)] + mgR cos(theta)
```

**Applying Euler-Lagrange equation:**

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot  ->  d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

**Equation of motion:**
```
theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R]
```

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0):

sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

This gives us:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top of hoop) - always exists  
3. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** - only exists when omega^2 >= g/R

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium by checking if f'(theta_0) < 0 (stable) where f(theta) is the RHS of the equation of motion.

f'(theta) = omega^2 cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos(theta)

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- f'(0) = omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable** if omega < omegac = sqrt(g/R)
- **Unstable** if omega > omegac

**At theta = pi (top):**
- f'(pi) = omega^2 + g/R > 0
- **Always unstable**

**At theta = theta_0 (if it exists):**
When omega > omegac, two symmetric equilibria appear at theta_0 and -theta_0
- These are **stable** equilibria

**Critical angular velocity:**
```
omegac = sqrt(g/R)
```

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Bifurcation behavior:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omegac: Only one stable equilibrium at the bottom (theta = 0)
- At omega = omegac: The bottom becomes marginally stable (bifurcation point)
- For omega > omegac: The bottom becomes unstable, and two NEW stable equilibria emerge symmetrically

The bead ""chooses"" to sit at an angle rather than at the bottom when centrifugal effects dominate gravity.

**Physical meaning:**
- At low rotation rates, gravity dominates -> bead stays at bottom
- At high rotation rates, the ""centrifugal force"" (in rotating frame) pushes the bead outward
- The bead finds a new equilibrium where centrifugal and gravitational components balance

**Model breakdown at very high omega:**

1. **Friction becomes significant** - we assumed frictionless, but air resistance scales with v^2
2. **Bead may leave the hoop** - if not constrained 
3. **Structural deformation** - the hoop itself may deform
4. **Relativistic effects** - at extreme speeds (unlikely but theoretically at R omega -> c)
5. **Vibrations** - the rigid body assumption breaks down

This gives us: x = y = z (all equal).

**Eigenspace:** $E_3 = \text{span}\left\{\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\right\}$ with **dimension 1**

### Is A Diagonalizable? **NO!**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the geometric multiplicity (1) is **less than** the algebraic multiplicity (2). We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for a 3*3 matrix to be diagonalizable.

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^100

### Geometric Interpretation:
A non-diagonalizable matrix means **there's no basis consisting entirely of eigenvectors**. The transformation doesn't just stretch/compress along independent directions-it also has a **""shearing"" component** that mixes coordinates together.

### Computing A^100:

**For diagonalizable matrices:** If $B = PDP^{-1}$, then:
$$B^{100} = PD^{100}P^{-1}$$
Easy! Just raise diagonal entries to the 100th power.

**For non-diagonalizable matrices:** We must use **Jordan Normal Form**: $A = PJP^{-1}$, where:

$$J = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$

Then $A^{100} = PJ^{100}P^{-1}$

**The challenge:** Jordan blocks don't simply raise to powers. For a 2*2 Jordan block:
$$\begin{bmatrix} \lambda & 1 \\ 0 & \lambda \end{bmatrix}^n = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda^n & n\lambda^{n-1} \\ 0 & \lambda^n \end{bmatrix}$$

So: $$J^{100} = \begin{bmatrix} 2^{100} & 100 \cdot 2^{99} & 0 \\ 0 & 2^{100} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3^{100} \end{bmatrix}$$

You get **polynomial growth terms** (the 100 coefficient), not just exponential powers!

It's **upper triangular**! Do you remember the shortcut for finding eigenvalues of triangular matrices?

<details>

So the eigenvalues are:

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

Now you need to find the eigenspace for each eigenvalue by solving **(A - lambdaI)v = 0**.

**For lambda = 2:**

Set up (A - 2I):
```
| 0  1  0 |
| 0  0  1 |
| 0  0  1 |
```

What does this system tell you? Try solving it:
- What does row 2 (or row 3) tell you about v_3?
- What does row 1 tell you about v_2?
- What about v_1?

You should find the eigenspace is **span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:**

Try setting up (A - 3I) and solving. You should get eigenspace = **span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

Here's the key question: For lambda = 2, what's the algebraic multiplicity vs. geometric multiplicity?

- Algebraic: 2
- Geometric: 1

**A is NOT diagonalizable** because geometric multiplicity != algebraic multiplicity for lambda = 2. We need 2 linearly independent eigenvectors for lambda = 2, but we only found 1!

A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that (in the right basis) just stretches/scales along independent directions. A non-diagonalizable matrix has ""shearing"" components-it can't be decomposed into pure scaling.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

If A were diagonalizable: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

Since A is NOT diagonalizable, you'd need **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where J has Jordan blocks. Computing J^1^0^0 is more complex-you need binomial theorem for the off-diagonal terms in each block.

I'll guide you through each part! Let me show you the approach and key concepts.

## (a) Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

**Key observation:** A is an upper triangular matrix!

For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

To verify, find the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det | 2-lambda   1    0  |
                  | 0    2-lambda   1  |

For triangular matrices, det = product of diagonal entries:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda) = 0
```

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |     ->    y = 0, z = 0, x is free
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |
```

Eigenspace: **E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

Eigenspace: **E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**NO!** Here's why:

A matrix is diagonalizable   geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues

- For lambda = 2: alg. mult. = 2, but geo. mult. = 1  
- Only 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total (need 3 for a 3*3 matrix)

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**

- **Diagonalizable matrix:** Pure scaling along n independent directions (the eigenvectors form a basis)
- **Non-diagonalizable matrix:** Combines scaling with ""shearing"" - there aren't enough independent eigendirections to span the space completely

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

**If diagonalizable:** A = PDP^-^1
- Then A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1
- D^1^0^0 is trivial: just raise each diagonal entry to the 100th power  

**Since NOT diagonalizable:** Use Jordan Normal Form: A = PJP^-^1

```
J = | 2  1  0 |  <- 2*2 Jordan block for lambda=2
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |

**Challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 requires the formula for Jordan blocks:

For | lambda  1 |  = | lambda    nlambda ^-^1 |
    | 0  lambda |     | 0    lambda     |

The off-diagonal terms don't vanish-they involve **binomial coefficients** and grow with n, making computation much more complex!

Coordinate system:
Let's use a fixed coordinate system with the z-axis along the verti","# Physics Assignment Solution: Rotating Bead on a Hoop

I'll guide you through this problem step-by-step. This is a beautiful example of classical mechanics!

---

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

**Setting up coordinates:**

Place the origin at the hoop's center. The bead's position in Cartesian coordinates:
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta  (negative since theta = 0 is at bottom)

**Finding velocities:**

Taking time derivatives:
- x_dot = R theta_dot cos theta cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R theta_dot cos theta sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R theta_dot sin theta

**Kinetic Energy:**

T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and using trig identities (cos^2 + sin^2 = 1):

**T =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2theta**

The first term is motion along the hoop; the second is circular motion with the hoop.

**Potential Energy:**

U = mgz = **-mgR cos theta**

**Lagrangian:**

```
L = T - U =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2theta + mgR cos theta
```

**Equation of Motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange: d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot  ->  d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin theta cos theta - mgR sin theta

This gives:

```
theta_ddot = sin theta (omega^2 cos theta - g/R)
```

---

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

sin theta (omega^2 cos theta - g/R) = 0

**Solution 1:** sin theta = 0  
-> **theta = 0** (bottom) or **theta = pi** (top)

**Solution 2:** cos theta = g/(Romega^2)  
-> Exists only when **omega >= omegac = sqrt(g/R)**  
-> **theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (two symmetric positions)

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium theta_0: let theta = theta_0 +  

The stability is determined by f'(theta_0) where f(theta) = sin theta (omega^2 cos theta - g/R)

f'(theta) = cos theta (omega^2 cos theta - g/R) - omega^2 sin^2theta

| Equilibrium | f'(theta_0) | Stability |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **theta = 0** | omega^2 - g/R | Stable if omega < omegac<br>Unstable if omega > omegac |
| **theta = pi** | omega^2 + g/R > 0 | Always unstable |
| **theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** | -omega^2sin^2theta_0 < 0 | Stable (when exists) |

**Critical angular velocity:**

```
omegac = sqrt(g/R)
```

At this value, the bottom equilibrium transitions from stable to unstable.

---

## **(c) Physical Interpretation**

**Physical meaning:**

- **Low rotation (omega < omegac):** Gravity dominates. The bead stays at the bottom. The centrifugal effect isn't strong enough to lift it.

- **High rotation (omega > omegac):** Centrifugal effects dominate. The bottom becomes unstable, and the bead rises to an elevated equilibrium position where centrifugal force balances the component of gravity pulling it down.

- **At omegac:** The transition point-a critical threshold.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omegac: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- For omega > omegac: one unstable equilibrium (theta = 0) and **two new stable equilibria** (theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2)))

The system's qualitative behavior changes at the bifurcation point. The number and stability of equilibria change suddenly at omegac.

**Model assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **No friction assumption:** At very high omega, air resistance becomes significant; the bead might not reach equilibrium.

2. **Rigid hoop:** The hoop might deform or vibrate at extreme angular velocities.

3. **Point mass bead:** The bead's finite size could matter; it might slip or tumble rather than sliding smoothly.

4. **No slipping:** At extreme speeds, the bead might lose contact with the hoop or experience complex contact dynamics.

5. **Perfect circular motion:** Wobbling or precession of the rotation axis might occur in real systems.

Great problem! This is a classic example of symmetry breaking. Let me guide you through each part.

## Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian

**Setting up coordinates:**

First, establish your coordinate system. With the hoop rotating about a vertical diameter:
- Use Cartesian coordinates: x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat), y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat), z = -R cos(theta)

**Your turn:** Take time derivatives to find x_dot, y_dot, and z_dot. What do you get?

<details>
<summary>Hint for kinetic energy</summary>

When you square the velocities and add them up, the cross terms from x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 should cancel. You should get something involving both theta_dot^2 and omega^2.

</details>

You should find:
- **T = (1/2)mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2sin^2(theta)]**
- **U = -mgR cos(theta)** (measuring height from the center)

So: **L = (1/2)mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2sin^2(theta)] + mgR cos(theta)**

**For the equation of motion:** Apply Euler-Lagrange: d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

Can you compute these partial derivatives?

**Answer:** theta_ddot = omega^2sin(theta)cos(theta) - (g/R)sin(theta)

## Part (b): Equilibrium and Stability

**Finding equilibria:** Set theta_ddot = 0:

0 = sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R]

This gives you:
1. **sin(theta) = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)
2. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** -> theta_eq = arccos(g/(Romega^2))

**Key insight:** Solution (2) only exists when omega^2 >= g/R!

**Stability analysis:**

Define an effective potential: V_eff = -(1/2)omega^2sin^2(theta) - (g/R)cos(theta)

For stability, check d^2V_eff/dtheta^2 at equilibrium points:

- **theta = 0 (bottom):** d^2V_eff/dtheta^2 = g/R - omega^2
  - Stable when **omega < omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**
  - Unstable when omega > omega_c

- **theta = pi (top):** Always unstable (verify this!)

- **theta_eq = arccos(g/(Romega^2)):** Stable when it exists (omega > omega_c)

**Critical angular velocity: omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**What to discuss:**

1. **Bifurcation:** At omega = omega_c, the system undergoes a **pitchfork bifurcation**
   - Below omega_c: Only one stable equilibrium (bottom)
   - Above omega_c: Bottom becomes unstable, two new stable positions appear symmetrically

2. **Physical mechanism:** The rotating frame creates an effective centrifugal force outward. At high omega, this dominates gravity, pushing the bead away from the axis.

3. **Assumptions that break down at high omega:**
   - Frictionless motion (air resistance becomes significant)
   - Rigid hoop (centrifugal forces could deform it)
   - Point mass bead (finite size matters)
   - Perfect circular motion
   - No relativistic effects (if omega gets absurdly large!)

So what do you get for the eigenvalues? Look at the diagonal: 2, 2, 3.

**Answer:**

- lambda = 3 with algebraic multiplicity 1

## Part (b): Finding Eigenspaces

**For lambda = 2:**
We need to solve (A - 2I)v = 0. Can you set up A - 2I?

A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |

Solving this system:
- From row 2 or 3: z = 0
- From row 1: y = 0  
- x is free

So the eigenspace is E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T} -> **dimension 1** (geometric multiplicity = 1)

**For lambda = 3:**
Now solve (A - 3I)v = 0:

A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |

Can you solve this? You should get: x = y = z

So E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T} -> **dimension 1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

Key theorem: A matrix is diagonalizable iff geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues.

- lambda = 2: alg. mult. = 2, geom. mult. = 1  
- lambda = 3: alg. mult. = 1, geom. mult. = 1  

**A is NOT diagonalizable** because we can only find 2 linearly independent eigenvectors (need 3 for a 3*3 matrix).

## Part (c): Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning:**
A diagonalizable matrix means you can find a basis of eigenvectors-directions that are simply stretched (not rotated/sheared). A non-diagonalizable matrix has ""defective"" eigenspaces that force some **shearing** behavior that can't be eliminated by changing basis.

- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop

**Coordinate system:**
Let me use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (the rotation axis), and the hoop rotates in the xy-plane's","# Physics Assignment Solutions - Rotating Hoop Problem

Great problem! Let me walk you through this classic Lagrangian mechanics example.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Place the origin at the center of the hoop with the z-axis vertical (along the rotation axis). The bead's position is:
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta

**Finding the velocities:**
- x_dot = R theta_dot cos theta cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R theta_dot cos theta sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R theta_dot sin theta

**Kinetic Energy:**

T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and simplifying (the cross terms cancel):

**T =  mR^2(theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2theta)**

**Potential Energy:**

V = mgz = -mgR cos theta

**Lagrangian:**

**L =  mR^2(theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2theta) + mgR cos theta**

**Equation of Motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange: d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin theta cos theta - mgR sin theta

This gives:

**theta_ddot = sin theta (omega^2 cos theta - g/R)**

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria:** Set theta_ddot = 0

sin theta (omega^2 cos theta - g/R) = 0

**Solutions:**

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **cos theta = g/(Romega^2)** -> theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))
   - Only exists when g/(Romega^2) <= 1, i.e., **omega >= omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

**Stability Analysis:**

For small perturbations theta = theta_0 +  , linearize to get:
 _ddot ~= f'(theta_0) 

where f'(theta) = omega^2 cos(2theta) - (g/R) cos theta

Stable if f'(theta_0) < 0 (restoring force)

| Equilibrium | f'(theta_0) | Stability |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **theta = 0** (bottom) | omega^2 - g/R | Stable if **omega < omegac**<br>Unstable if **omega > omegac** |
| **theta = pi** (top) | omega^2 + g/R > 0 | Always **unstable** |
| **theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))** | g^2/(R^2omega^2) - omega^2 < 0 | **Stable** (when they exist) |

**Critical angular velocity:**

**omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation and Bifurcation

**Physical Meaning:**

- At **low omega < omegac**: The bead sits at the bottom. Gravity dominates over the centrifugal effect.

- At **omega = omegac**: Critical point! The centrifugal and gravitational forces exactly balance at the bottom.

- At **high omega > omegac**: The bottom becomes unstable. The bead moves to one of two new stable positions symmetrically placed above the ""equator."" Here, centrifugal force (pushing outward from the rotation axis) balances the component of gravity pulling toward the bottom.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omegac: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- At omega = omegac: bifurcation point
- For omega > omegac: the original equilibrium becomes unstable, and two new symmetric stable equilibria appear

The number and stability of equilibria change qualitatively at the critical parameter value.

**Model assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless constraint**: At very high omega, even tiny friction would generate significant heat
2. **Rigid hoop**: Centrifugal forces could deform or break the hoop
3. **Point mass bead**: The bead's finite size might matter
4. **No air resistance**: Drag forces become significant at high speeds
5. **Perfect constraint**: The bead might lose contact with the hoop or the hoop might not maintain circular shape
6. **Non-relativistic mechanics**: For extremely high omega, though this would require absurdly high speeds

What are you stuck on?",0,2045,2045,2553,34.06,"Great! This is a nice linear algebra problem about eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalizability. Let me work through this step by step.

**Part (a): Finding eigenvalues**

The matrix A is:

    | 0  0  3 |

This is an upper triangular matrix! For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries.

         | 0     0   3-lambda |

Since this","# Linear Algebra Help - Eigenvalues and Diagonalizability

Let me walk you through this problem step by step!

## Part (a): Finding Eigenvalues

First, notice that **A is upper triangular**! This is a huge hint.

For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

To verify formally, find det(A - lambdaI) = 0:

```
A - lambdaI = | 2-lambda   1    0  |
         | 0    2-lambda   1  |
         | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

Since it's triangular, det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = **(2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |     v_2 = 0
         | 0  0  1 |  ->  v_3 = 0
         | 0  0  1 |     v_1 is free
```

Eigenspace: **E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> dimension = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |
```

From row 2: v_3 = v_2  
From row 1: v_1 = v_2

Eigenspace: **E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> dimension = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO!**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2:
- Algebraic multiplicity = 2
- Geometric multiplicity (dim of eigenspace) = 1

Since geometric multiplicity < algebraic multiplicity, **A is defective and NOT diagonalizable**.

We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors, but need 3 for a basis of R^3.

## Part (c): Geometric Meaning and Computing A^100

**Geometric interpretation:**
A non-diagonalizable matrix has ""defective"" eigenspaces-not enough eigenvectors to span the space. Geometrically, this means the transformation can't be decomposed into pure scaling along independent directions. There's some ""shearing"" or ""mixing"" that happens alongside the scaling.

**Computing A^100:**

- **If diagonalizable:** A = PDP^-^1, so A^100 = PD^100P^-^1  
  (Just raise each diagonal entry to the 100th power-easy!)

- **Since A is NOT diagonalizable:** We need **Jordan Normal Form**  
  A = PJP^-^1 where J has Jordan blocks

For this matrix: J = | 2  1  0 |  
                     | 0  2  0 |  
                     | 0  0  3 |

**The challenge:** Jordan blocks don't simply raise to powers like diagonal matrices. For a 2*2 Jordan block with eigenvalue lambda:

| lambda  1 |^n = | lambda     nlambda ^-^1 |
| 0  lambda |     | 0     lambda     |

So computing A^100 requires finding P, computing J^100 (using the formula above), then A^100 = PJ^100P^-^1.

Let me work through this systematically.

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up the coordinate system:
- The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with constant angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The bead is at radius R from the center

Let me use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis).

Position of the","# Physics Assignment Solutions - Rotating Hoop Problem

Great problem! Let me work through this systematically.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Place the center of the hoop at the origin
- z-axis vertical (upward positive)
- theta measured from bottom of hoop
- Hoop rotates with angular velocity omega about vertical diameter

**Position of bead in Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Velocity components:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic energy:**
Computing v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2) =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]

**Potential energy:**
V = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2(\theta)] + mgR\cos(\theta)}$$

**Equation of motion:**
Using Euler-Lagrange equation: d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin(\theta)\left[\omega^2\cos(\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

sin(theta_0)[omega^2cos(theta_0) - g/R] = 0

This gives three cases:

1. **theta_0 = 0** (bottom of hoop) - always exists
2. **theta_0 = pi** (top of hoop) - always exists  
3. **cos(theta_0) = g/(Romega^2)** - exists only when **omega >= sqrt(g/R)**

**Stability analysis:**
Linearize around equilibrium: theta = theta_0 +  

The linearized equation gives:  _ddot = [omega^2cos(2theta_0) - (g/R)cos(theta_0)] 

Stable if coefficient < 0, unstable if > 0.

**For theta_0 = 0:**
-  _ddot = [omega^2 - g/R] 
- **Stable when omega < sqrt(g/R)**
- **Unstable when omega > sqrt(g/R)**

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**For theta_0 = pi:**
-  _ddot = [omega^2 + g/R]  > 0
- **Always unstable**

**For theta_0 = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omegac):
- Coefficient = g^2/(R^2omega^2) - omega^2 < 0 for omega > sqrt(g/R)
- **Stable** - these are the ""off-bottom"" equilibria

## Part (c): Physical Discussion

**Physical meaning:**

At low rotation rates (omega < omegac), gravity dominates and the bead sits stably at the bottom. As omega increases past the critical value omegac = sqrt(g/R), the centrifugal effect overcomes gravity, and the bottom becomes unstable. The bead now prefers to sit at an angle where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omegac: one stable equilibrium (bottom)
- At omega = omegac: critical point (bifurcation)
- For omega > omegac: bottom becomes unstable, two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically

The number and stability of equilibria change qualitatively at the critical parameter value.

**Model breakdown at high omega:**

1. **Friction becomes significant** - at very high speeds, air resistance and bearing friction matter
2. **Hoop deformation** - centrifugal forces may deform the hoop
3. **Bead doesn't stay on hoop** - normal force could become unrealistically large
4. **Relativistic effects** (extreme case!)
5. **Material failure** - structural limits of real materials

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**Key observation:** A is an upper triangular matrix! This makes life easier.

For an upper triangular matrix, the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries.

The characteristic polynomial is:
det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)

**Eigenvalues:**
- lambda = 2 with algebraic multiplicity 2
- lambda = 3 with algebraic multiplicity 1

| 0  1  0 | |x|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |y| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |z|   |0|

This gives us: y = 0, z = 0, and x is free.

```

This gives us: x = y = z (all equal).

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> dimension = 1

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**NO!** Here's why:
- For lambda = 2: algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1)
- We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but need 3 for a 3*3 matrix
- **Diagonalizability requires:** geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
A non-diagonalizable matrix means there's no basis of eigenvectors. Geometrically, the transformation ""shears"" space in a way that can't be decomposed into pure stretching along independent directions.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a diagonalizable matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

Where J = | 2  1  0 |  (Jordan block for lambda=2)
          | 0  2  0 |
          | 0  0  3 |

The challenge: Computing J^1^0^0 requires the **binomial theorem** for the nilpotent part, which is more tedious than just raising diagonal entries to the 100th power.

- Hoop rotates about vertical diameter with constant angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- No friction

I'll guide them through each part:

(a) Deriving t","Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me help you work through it step-by-step.

## Part (a): Setting up the Lagrangian

**First, let's establish the coordinate system:**
- Place origin at center of hoop
- z-axis vertical (upward positive)
- Hoop rotates about z-axis with angular velocity omega

**Position of the bead in the inertial frame:**

If theta is measured from the bottom:
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta

**Now find the velocity components:**

Taking time derivatives:
- x_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin theta * theta_dot

**Calculate kinetic energy:**

After computing x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2 (try this yourself - use trig identities!), you should get:

**T =  m R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2 theta]**

**Potential energy:**

**U = mgz = -mgR cos theta**

**Therefore, the Lagrangian is:**

**L =  m R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2 theta] + mgR cos theta**

**Equation of motion (Euler-Lagrange):**

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin theta cos theta - mgR sin theta

d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2 theta_ddot

This gives you:

**theta_ddot = sin theta [omega^2 cos theta - g/R]**

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

sin theta [omega^2 cos theta - g/R] = 0

This gives:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top) - always exists  
3. **cos theta = g/(omega^2R)** - only exists when omega^2 >= g/R

**Stability analysis:**

Define effective potential: U_eff = - omega^2R^2 sin^2 theta - mgR cos theta

Check the second derivative at each equilibrium:

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- d^2U_eff/dtheta^2 = g/R - omega^2
- Stable when **omega < omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**
- Unstable when **omega > omega_c**

**At theta = pi (top):**
- d^2U_eff/dtheta^2 = -g/R - omega^2 < 0
- **Always unstable**

**At theta = arccos(g/(omega^2R))** (exists for omega > omega_c):
- d^2U_eff/dtheta^2 = omega^2 - g^2/(omega^2R^2) > 0 for omega > omega_c
- **Stable** (there are two symmetric positions, +/-theta)

**Critical angular velocity: omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

At omega < omega_c: Only one stable equilibrium (bottom)

At omega = omega_c: Bifurcation point - bottom becomes unstable

At omega > omega_c: Bottom is unstable, but two NEW stable equilibria appear symmetrically displaced from bottom

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation** - one equilibrium splits into three as a parameter crosses a critical value.

**Physical meaning:**

At low rotation rates, gravity dominates and keeps the bead at the bottom. As omega increases, the centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) creates an outward force proportional to the distance from the rotation axis (R sin theta). Above omega_c, this centrifugal effect overpowers gravity, and the bead is flung outward to a new equilibrium where the two forces balance.

**Model breakdown at high omega:**

- Air resistance becomes significant
- The ""frictionless"" assumption fails - heating occurs
- Material stress - the hoop might deform or break
- Relativistic effects (though that's VERY high omega!)
- The constraint might fail - bead could fly off

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**Key insight:** Notice that A is an upper triangular matrix!

For triangular matrices, there's a shortcut: the eigenvalues are just the **diagonal entries**.

The characteristic polynomial is:
det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = 0

**Eigenvalues:**
- lambda = 2 with **algebraic multiplicity 2** (appears twice)
- lambda = 3 with **algebraic multiplicity 1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |

What's the null space? 
- Row 2 tells you v_3 = 0
- Row 1 tells you v_2 = 0  
- v_1 is free!

So eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)} -> **geometric multiplicity = 1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0 (try this yourself!)

**Critical question for diagonalizability:** 
Does geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for each eigenvalue?
- For lambda = 2: geometric (1) != algebraic (2)  

**Answer:** A is **NOT diagonalizable** because we can't find 3 linearly independent eigenvectors.

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometrically:** A non-diagonalizable matrix has a ""shearing"" component. You cannot find a basis where the transformation is just pure scaling.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**
- **If diagonalizable:** A = PDP^-^1 -> A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (super easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100)
- **Since NOT diagonalizable:** Must use **Jordan Normal Form** A = PJP^-^1, where J has small 1's above the diagonal. Computing J^1^0^0 requires the binomial theorem and is much messier!

         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |

Row reduce to:
| 0  1  0 |
| 0  0  1 |
| 0  0  0 |

This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |

This gives: v_2 = v_1 and v_3 = v_2, so v_3 = v_2 = v_1

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO**

**Justification:** A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for all eigenvalues.

- For lambda = 2: alg. mult. = 2, but geom. mult. = 1  
- We have only 2 eigenvectors total, but need 3 for a 3*3 matrix

## (c) Geometric Interpretation and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**

A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that purely **stretches/compresses** along independent directions (eigenvector axes). You can think of it as reshaping a sphere into an ellipsoid aligned with coordinate axes.

A non-diagonalizable matrix introduces **shearing** in addition to stretching. The transformation ""tilts"" or ""skews"" space in a way that can't be decomposed into independent directional stretches. There's a coupling between directions.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

**If A were diagonalizable:** A = PDP^-^1
- Then A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1
- D^1^0^0 is trivial: just raise diagonal entries to 100th power!

**Since A is NOT diagonalizable:** We use **Jordan Normal Form**
- A = PJP^-^1 where J has form: | 2  1  0 |
                                | 0  2  0 |
                                | 0  0  3 |

**The challenge:** J^1^0^0 != just diagonal entries to the 100th power! The ""1"" above the diagonal creates interaction terms. You'd need to use the formula for powers of Jordan blocks, which involves binomial coefficients.

This is an upper triangular matrix.

**(a) Finding eigenvalues:**

For a triangular matrix (upper or lower), the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries!

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**What do you know about triangular matrices?** This is key here!

Since A is upper triangular, there's a shortcut: the eigenvalues are just the **diagonal entries**.

So: **lambda = 2** (appears twice) and **lambda = 3** (appears once)

More formally:
- Eigenvalue lambda = 2 with **algebraic multiplicity 2**
- Eigenvalue lambda = 3 with **algebraic multiplicity 1**

You can verify this by computing det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda) = 0

---

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |

From this system:
- Row 1: y = 0
- Row 2 & 3: z = 0  
- x is free

**Eigenspace:** E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)} -> **geometric multiplicity = 1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |

This gives: x = y = z (let all equal t)

**Eigenspace:** E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)} -> **geometric multiplicity = 1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**NO!** Here's why:

For lambda = 2: algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1)

We only have **2 linearly independent eigenvectors** total, but we need **3** for a 3*3 matrix to be diagonalizable.

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**

A non-diagonalizable matrix has a ""defective"" eigenspace - it can't be completely decomposed into independent directions. Geometrically, lambda = 2 represents a direction where the transformation ""collapses"" - there aren't enough independent eigenvectors to span that eigenspace.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a **diagonalizable** matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices like this one, you need:

1. **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where J has Jordan blocks
2. The Jordan block for lambda = 2 looks like: | 2  1 |
                                            | 0  2 |
3. Computing J^1^0^0 is harder - you need the binomial theorem for nilpotent matrices

**The challenge:** Jordan blocks don't just raise diagonal elements - the off-diagonal 1's create extra terms when raising to powers.

<details>
<summary>Click after you've tried</summary>

**Answer:** NO, A is not diagonalizable (we only have 2 eigenvectors but need 3)

## (c) Geometric Interpretation

**Geometric meaning:** 
- A diagonalizable matrix has enough eigenvectors to form a basis
- In those directions, the transformation just stretches/shrinks
- Non-diagonalizable matrices have ""shearing"" behavior that can't be eliminated by any change of basis

Think of lambda = 2: the transformation ""wants"" to act like scaling by 2 in a 2D space, but only has a 1D eigenspace. The matrix has a defect!

**Computing A^100:**

For **diagonalizable** matrices: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices like this one, you'd use:
- **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where J contains Jordan blocks
- Or exploit that A is triangular with a specific pattern

- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- No friction

**Coordinate system:**
Let's use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis), and the hoop rotates in th","# Physics Homework Help - Rotating Hoop Problem

Great classic problem! Let me walk you through this systematically.

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Place origin at hoop center, z-axis vertical (rotation axis)
- Bead position at angle theta from bottom
- Hoop rotates with angular velocity omega

**Position of bead:**
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta

**VelocityComponents:**
Taking derivatives:
- x_dot = R cos theta theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin theta theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**
T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and using trig identities (cos^2 + sin^2 = 1):

**T =  mR^2(theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2 theta)**

**Potential Energy:**
V = mgz = -mgR cos theta

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2(\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta) + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Euler-Lagrange Equation:**
$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin theta cos theta - mgR sin theta

**Equation of motion:**
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

**Solution 1:** sin theta = 0  
-> **theta = 0** (bottom) and **theta = pi** (top)

**Solution 2:** omega^2 cos theta = g/R  
-> **cos theta = g/(omega^2R)**

This exists only when |g/(omega^2R)| <= 1, i.e., when:
$$\boxed{\omega \geq \omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium by finding:
$$\frac{d}{d\theta}\left[\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)\right]$$

This gives: **omega^2 cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos theta**

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- Stability coefficient = omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable if omega < omega_c**  
- **Unstable if omega > omega_c**  

**At theta = pi (top):**
- Stability coefficient = -omega^2 + g/R = -(omega^2 - g/R)  
- **Always unstable** (for positive omega)  

**At theta = arccos(g/(omega^2R)) (inclined position):**
- Exists only for omega > omega_c
- Stability coefficient = g^2/(omega^2R^2) - omega^2 < 0
- **Stable when it exists**  

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

## **(c) Physical Interpretation and Bifurcation**

**Physical Meaning:**

When the hoop rotates slowly (omega < omega_c), the bead sits at the bottom - gravity dominates. As rotation speed increases, the bead experiences an outward ""centrifugal force"" (in the rotating frame). At omega = omega_c, the bottom position becomes unstable, and the bead spontaneously moves to an inclined equilibrium position where centrifugal and gravitational effects balance.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omega_c: ONE stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- At omega = omega_c: **bifurcation point** - stability changes
- For omega > omega_c: THREE equilibria (theta = 0 unstable, +/-theta_0 stable)

The system qualitatively changes behavior at the critical parameter value - the hallmark of bifurcation!

**Model breakdown at high omega:**

1. **Friction becomes important** - at high speeds, air resistance is non-negligible
2. **Material stress** - the hoop may deform or break
3. **Constraint violation** - the bead might fly off due to imperfect surface
4. **Relativistic effects** - if omegaR approaches c (totally unrealistic but theoretically!)
5. **Non-rigid body effects** - vibrations in the hoop structure

What are you working on?",0,3693,3693,3764,61.05,"This is a classic problem in Lagrangian mechanics - the rotating hoop problem. Let me work through this systematically to help the student understand.

Let me set up the problem:
- Bead of mass m on a circular hoop of radius R
- Hoop rotates about vertical diameter with constant angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- No friction

I should guide them through this step by step.

**Part (a): Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up coordinates. Let's us","Great problem! This is a classic example in analytical mechanics. Let me walk you through the approach - I'll guide you but make sure you understand each step.

## Part (a): Setting up the Lagrangian

**First, what coordinates should we use?**

Since the hoop rotates with constant omega about the vertical diameter, let me help you set up the position vector:

In a fixed (inertial) frame with the z-axis vertical:
- Distance from rotation axis: **r = R sin theta**
- Height above center: **z = -R cos theta** (negative since theta = 0 is at bottom)
- Azimuthal angle: **phi = omegat** (the bead rotates with the hoop)

**Now try writing the velocity components:**

Cartesian position:
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta

Can you differentiate these to get x_dot, y_dot, z_dot? Give it a shot and then check below:

<details>
<summary>Velocity calculation</summary>

- x_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin theta * theta_dot

Now compute v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 = R^2cos^2theta * theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2 sin^2theta  
(the cross terms cancel!)

So: **v^2 = R^2theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2 sin^2theta**
</details>

**Kinetic and Potential Energy:**

T = (1/2)m(R^2theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2 sin^2theta) = **(1/2)mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2theta]**

V = mgz = **-mgR cos theta**

**Therefore, the Lagrangian is:**

$$L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta$$

**Equation of motion** - Apply Euler-Lagrange:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$

Try computing each term. You should get:

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

---

## Part (b): Equilibria and Stability

**Finding equilibria:** Set theta_ddot = 0:

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives you two cases:

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **omega^2cos theta = g/R** -> cos theta = g/(Romega^2)

   This only has a solution when g/(Romega^2) <= 1, meaning **omega >= sqrt(g/R)**

**Stability analysis:**

For small perturbations theta = theta_eq +  , linearize the equation of motion. The key is to find:

$$\frac{d}{d\theta}\left[\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)\right]\Bigg|_{\theta_{eq}}$$

This gives: omega^2cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos theta

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- Coefficient: omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable if omega < omega_c**, **unstable if omega > omega_c**
- where **omega_c = sqrt(g/R)** <- critical angular velocity

**At theta = pi (top):**
- Always unstable (as expected!)

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omega_c):
- These new equilibria are **stable**
- Two symmetric positions appear (+/-theta from vertical axis)

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**What's happening physically?**

- At low rotation rates (omega < omega_c): gravity dominates -> bead stays at bottom
- At high rotation rates (omega > omega_c): centrifugal effect dominates -> bead climbs up the hoop to a new equilibrium

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omega_c: one stable equilibrium (bottom)
- At omega = omega_c: critical point where bottom equilibrium loses stability  
- For omega > omega_c: bottom is unstable, but TWO new stable equilibria appear

The number and stability of equilibria change at the critical parameter value!

**What breaks down at high omega?**

Think about the idealizations:
- **Rigid hoop assumption** - might deform under stress
- **Constraint forces** - may not keep bead on hoop (could exceed material strength)
- **Frictionless** - air resistance becomes significant
- **Point mass** - bead has finite size, may experience additional forces
- **Perfect rigidity of rotation axis**

I'll guide you through this problem step-by-step! Let me help you understand the concepts as we go.

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

To find eigenvalues, we need to solve det(A - lambdaI) = 0.

**Key observation**: A is an upper triangular matrix! This makes our life easier.

For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

So we get:
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces

**For lambda = 2:**
Solve (A - 2I)v = 0:

```
| 0  1  0 | |x|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |y| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |z|   |0|
```

This gives: y = 0, z = 0, and x is free.

**Eigenspace**: E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)} -> dimension = **1**

**For lambda = 3:**
Solve (A - 3I)v = 0:

```
|-1  1  0 | |x|   |0|
| 0 -1  1 | |y| = |0|
| 0  0  0 | |z|   |0|
```

This gives: x = y = z

**Eigenspace**: E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)} -> dimension = **1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**NO!** Here's why:

For diagonalizability, we need: geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for each eigenvalue.

- For lambda = 2: geometric mult. (1) != algebraic mult. (2)  

Since we only have 2 total linearly independent eigenvectors but need 3 for a 3*3 matrix, **A is defective and non-diagonalizable**.

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
- A diagonalizable matrix can be thought of as stretching/compressing along independent eigenvector directions
- A **non-diagonalizable** matrix has a ""shearing"" component-it distorts space in ways that can't be decomposed into pure stretches along perpendicular axes
- We're missing enough eigenvectors to form a complete basis

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For diagonalizable matrices: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, we need the **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J has Jordan blocks
- For this matrix: J = | 2  1  0 |
                        | 0  2  0 |
                        | 0  0  3 |

Computing J^1^0^0 is harder because of the 1's above the diagonal-you need the binomial theorem to handle powers of nilpotent matrices.

**Challenge**: Matrix powers don't simplify as nicely; you get polynomial terms mixed with exponential growth.

- The bead can slide around the hoop (with velocity R theta_dot)
- The bead also gets carried around by the rotating hoop

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m(v_1^2 + v_2^2) = \frac{1}{2}mR^2(\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta)$$

**Potential energy:**
Taking the center of the hoop as the reference point:
$$U = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$L = T - U = \frac{1}{2}mR^2(\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta) + mgR\cos\theta$$

**Now apply Euler-Lagrange equation.** Can you compute:
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}}$ and its time derivative
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta}$

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial\theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

</details>

## Part (b): Equilibrium positions and stability

**Finding equilibria:** Set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$. From our equation of motion:

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives us:

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)
2. **omega^2cos theta = g/R** -> $\cos\theta = \frac{g}{\omega^2 R}$

For solution (2) to exist physically, what condition must omega satisfy?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
We need |cos theta| <= 1, so $\frac{g}{\omega^2 R} \leq 1$, which means:

$$\omega \geq \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}} = \omega_c$$

So these ""tilted"" equilibria only exist above a critical rotation rate!
</details>

**Stability analysis:**

For linear stability, perturb around equilibrium: theta = theta_0 +  theta (small)

The linearized equation becomes: $\ddot{\delta\theta} = f'(\theta_0)\delta\theta$

where $f(\theta) = \sin\theta(\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R)$

Calculate:
$$f'(\theta) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

**Stable if f'(theta_0) < 0** (restoring force)

- **At theta = 0:** $f'(0) = \omega^2 - g/R$
  - Stable if $\omega^2 < g/R$  
  - Unstable if $\omega^2 > g/R$  

- **At theta = pi:** $f'(\pi) = \omega^2 + g/R > 0$ -> Always unstable

- **At** $\cos\theta_* = g/(\omega^2 R)$: (requires some algebra)
  - These are **stable** when they exist (omega > omegac)

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

## Part (c): Physical interpretation

**What's happening physically?**

At low rotation speeds (omega < omegac), gravity dominates and the bead sits at the bottom. As you spin faster, there's a competition between:
- Gravity pulling the bead down
- Centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) pushing the bead outward

At omega = omegac, the bottom becomes unstable and the bead ""prefers"" to move to a tilted position where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. At omega < omegac: one stable equilibrium (bottom). At omega > omegac: the bottom becomes unstable and TWO new stable equilibria appear symmetrically (+/-theta*). The system spontaneously breaks the rotational symmetry!

**What breaks down at high omega?**

Think about the assumptions:
- **Frictionless sliding** - at very high omega, even tiny friction becomes significant
- **Rigid hoop** - might deform or break
- **Point mass bead** - might fly off or the ""no friction"" assumption fails
- **Perfect rotation** - mechanical vibrations, wobble
- **Air resistance** - becomes significant at high speeds

Does this all make sense? Want to work through any part in more detail?"

**Part (a): Derive the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

Let me set up a coordinate system. The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega. Let's use theta as the angle from the bottom of the hoop (so theta = 0 at the bottom, theta = pi at the top).

The position of the bead in cylindrical coordinates (or Cartesian):
- The bead is at angle theta from the bottom of the ","# Physics Assignment Solution - Rotating Hoop Problem

Great problem! This is a classic example in analytical mechanics. Let me walk you through it.

## (a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

With the hoop rotating about its vertical diameter at angular velocity omega, the bead's position in the lab frame is:
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

where theta = 0 at the bottom.

**Finding velocities:**
- x_dot = Rtheta_dot cos(theta) cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = Rtheta_dot cos(theta) sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = Rtheta_dot sin(theta)

**Kinetic Energy:**

T = (m/2)(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and simplifying (the cross terms cancel):

**T = (mR^2/2)[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]**

**Potential Energy:**

V = mgz = **-mgR cos(theta)**

**Lagrangian:**

$$\boxed{L = \frac{mR^2}{2}[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2(\theta)] + mgR\cos(\theta)}$$

**Euler-Lagrange Equation:**

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

This gives:

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin(\theta)\left[\omega^2 \cos(\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

---

## (b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0):

sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

**Solutions:**

1. **theta = 0** (bottom) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top) - always exists  
3. **theta  = arccos(g/Romega^2)** - exists only when omega^2 >= g/R

**Stability Analysis:**

For small perturbations  theta around equilibrium theta_0:

 theta_ddot ~= f'(theta_0) theta where f'(theta) = omega^2cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos(theta)

Stable if f'(theta_0) < 0, unstable if f'(theta_0) > 0.

| Equilibrium | f'(theta_0) | Stability |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **theta = 0** (bottom) | omega^2 - g/R | Stable if omega < omegac<br>Unstable if omega > omegac |
| **theta = pi** (top) | omega^2 + g/R > 0 | Always unstable |
| **theta  = arccos(g/Romega^2)** | g^2/R^2omega^2 - omega^2 < 0 | Stable (when it exists) |

**Critical angular velocity:**

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

At omega = omegac, the bottom equilibrium changes from stable to unstable, and two new stable equilibria appear symmetrically.

---

## (c) Physical Interpretation

**Physical Meaning:**

- **For omega < omegac:** Gravity dominates. The bead sits stably at the bottom despite rotation.

- **For omega > omegac:** Centrifugal effects dominate. The bottom becomes unstable, and the bead moves to elevated positions (+/-theta ) where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance.

**Bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- At omega = omegac, the system undergoes a qualitative change
- One stable equilibrium (bottom) -> becomes unstable
- Two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically
- This is spontaneous symmetry breaking

**Model Assumptions That Break Down at High omega:**

1. **Frictionless constraint:** Air resistance becomes significant at high speeds
2. **Rigid hoop:** Centrifugal forces may deform the hoop
3. **Point mass bead:** Finite bead size matters for very fast rotation
4. **Perfect constraint:** Bead may bounce/lose contact with hoop
5. **Classical mechanics:** At extreme omega, relativistic effects (though practically never reached)

I'll walk you through each part! Let me show you the process:

## Part (a): Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

**Key observation**: A is an upper triangular matrix!

For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

To verify, find the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1     0   |
                  | 0     2-lambda   1   |
                  | 0     0     3-lambda |
```

Since it's triangular: **det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |     Row reduce to:    | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |                ->      | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |                       | 0  0  0 |
```

This gives: x_2 = 0, x_3 = 0, x_1 is free

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
A - 3I = | -1  1   0 |
         |  0  -1  1 |
         |  0  0   0 |
```

From row 2: x_3 = x_2  
From row 1: x_1 = x_2

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if geometric multiplicity equals algebraic multiplicity for every eigenvalue. Since this condition fails, **A is not diagonalizable**.

---

## Part (c): Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizability:**

A diagonalizable matrix has enough independent eigenvectors to form a basis. Geometrically, the transformation can be completely described by scaling along eigendirections.

A **non-diagonalizable** matrix has a ""defect"" - it performs both scaling AND shearing. The eigenspace for lambda=2 is only 1-dimensional when it ""should"" be 2-dimensional, meaning there aren't enough independent directions that get purely scaled.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

*For diagonalizable matrices:* A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

*For non-diagonalizable matrices:* Use **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J is the Jordan form
- For this matrix: J = | 2  1  0 |
                        | 0  2  0 |
                        | 0  0  3 |

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**The challenge**: Computing J^1^0^0 requires the binomial theorem for Jordan blocks, which is more complex than just raising diagonal entries to the 100th power.

## Part (a): Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

**Key observation:** A is an upper triangular matrix!

For triangular matrices, there's a nice shortcut: **the eigenvalues are exactly the diagonal entries**.

  **NO!** 

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 to form a basis for R^3.

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable matrices:**

A diagonalizable matrix can be thought of as one that stretches/compresses along independent directions (eigenvectors). A non-diagonalizable matrix has ""defective"" eigenspaces-it mixes stretching with **shearing**. The transformation can't be decomposed into independent scalings.

Since A isn't diagonalizable, we use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

J = | 2  1  0 |

For a triangular matr","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

I'll walk you through this step-by-step so you understand the concepts!

## Part (a): Finding Eigenvalues

To find eigenvalues, we need to solve det(A - lambdaI) = 0.

Notice that A is **upper triangular**! This is great because for triangular matrices, the determinant equals the product of diagonal entries.

A - lambdaI = | 2-lambda   1     0   |
         | 0     2-lambda   1   |
         | 0     0     3-lambda |

So: det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = **(2-lambda)^2(3-lambda) = 0**

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|

From this: v_2 = 0 and v_3 = 0, but v_1 is free.

**Eigenspace for lambda = 2:** span{**[1, 0, 0]^T**} -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|

This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**Eigenspace for lambda = 3:** span{**[1, 1, 1]^T**} -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**NO!** Here's why:

For diagonalizability, we need: **geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity** for each eigenvalue.

- For lambda = 2: alg. mult. = 2, but geom. mult. = **1**  
- For lambda = 3: alg. mult. = 1, geom. mult. = 1  

We only have **2 linearly independent eigenvectors** total, but we need **3** for a 3*3 matrix. So A is **not diagonalizable**.

## Part (c): Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizability:**

A diagonalizable matrix can be thought of as one that *stretches* space along independent directions (its eigenvectors). Non-diagonalizable matrices also have a **shearing** component-they don't just stretch, they also ""tilt"" or ""skew"" certain directions because they lack enough independent eigenvector directions.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a **diagonalizable** matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices like ours, use **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J is almost diagonal but has 1's on the superdiagonal
- Computing J^1^0^0 is harder because it involves binomial coefficients
- The entries grow polynomially with the exponent

**The challenge:** Non-diagonalizable matrices mix scaling with shearing, so powers don't simplify neatly-you get polynomial terms multiplying the exponential growth.

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

## **(c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0**

### Geometric Interpretation:
A **non-diagonalizable matrix** represents a linear transformation that cannot be expressed as pure scaling along independent directions. The eigenvalue lambda = 2 has a ""defective"" eigenspace-there aren't enough eigenvectors to span the full space affected by this eigenvalue. This creates a **shearing effect** in addition to scaling.

### Computing A^1^0^0:

**For diagonalizable matrices:** If A = PDP^-^1, then A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! just raise diagonal entries to the 100th power)

**For A (non-diagonalizable):** Use **Jordan Normal Form**

A = PJP^-^1 where J = | 2  1  0 |
                      | 0  2  0 |
                      | 0  0  3 |

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 requires the formula:
```
| lambda  1  0 |^1^0^0   | lambda^1^0^0   100lambda^9^9    0      |
| 0  lambda  0 |    = | 0      lambda^1^0^0      0      |
| 0  0  mu |      | 0      0         mu^1^0^0   |
```

So J^1^0^0 = | 2^1^0^0   100*2^9^9    0    |
         | 0      2^1^0^0       0    |
         | 0      0          3^1^0^0 |

This is more complex than just exponentiating diagonal entries!

For a triangular matrix (upper or lower), the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries.

So the eigenvalues are: 2, 2, 3

- lambda_1 = 2 with algebraic multiplicity 2
- lambda_2 = 3 with algebraic multiplicity 1

We can verify this by computing det(A - lambdaI) = 0:

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**:

**Eigenvalues:**
- lambda = 2 with algebraic multiplicity 2
- lambda = 3 with algebraic multiplicity 1

We can verify: det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)  

---

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces & Checking Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |

This gives us: x_2 = 0, x_3 = 0, x_1 is free

**Eigenspace:** E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}  
**Geometric multiplicity = 1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |

This gives us: x_1 = x_2 = x_3 (let x_3 = t)

**Eigenspace:** E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}  
**Geometric multiplicity = 1**

### Is A diagonalizable? **NO**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the geometric multiplicity (1) != algebraic multiplicity (2). We need 3 linearly independent eigenvectors for a 3*3 matrix to be diagonalizable, but we only have 2.

---

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
- A diagonalizable matrix represents pure **scaling** along independent eigendirections
- A non-diagonalizable matrix includes **shearing** components-the transformation can't be decomposed into simple stretches along perpendicular axes
- There's no basis consisting entirely of eigenvectors

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For **diagonalizable** matrices: B = PDP^-^1 -> B^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices like A, use **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J = | 2  1  0 |
                       | 0  2  0 |
                       | 0  0  3 |

To compute J^1^0^0, write J = 2I + N (for the 2*2 block) where N is nilpotent:

J^1^0^0 = | 2^1^0^0    100*2^9^9    0    |
       | 0       2^1^0^0        0    |
       | 0       0           3^1^0^0 |

**Challenges:** The off-diagonal terms create polynomial factors (like 100*2^9^9), requiring binomial expansion. Much messier than just exponentiating diagonal entries!

- theta is measured from the bottom
- The hoop rotates with angular veloci","# Physics Assignment: Rotating Hoop Problem

Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it step by step.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
Place the origin at the center of the hoop. With theta measured from the bottom:
- Vertical position: z = -R cos(theta)
- Horizontal distance from axis: rho = R sin(theta)  
- Azimuthal angle: phi = omegat (forced by rotating hoop)

**Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Computing velocities:**
- x_dot = R theta_dot cos(theta) cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R theta_dot cos(theta) sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R theta_dot sin(theta)

**Kinetic Energy:**
After computing v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Euler-Lagrange equation:**
$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$
- $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

**Equation of motion:**
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set theta_ddot = 0):
$$\sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

**Solutions:**

1. **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top of hoop) - always exists  
3. **cos theta = g/(Romega^2)** - exists only if **omega^2 >= g/R**

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium theta_0 by setting theta = theta_0 +  :

$$\ddot{\varepsilon} \approx \left[-\frac{g}{R}\cos\theta_0 + \omega^2\cos(2\theta_0)\right]\varepsilon$$

Stable if coefficient < 0, unstable if > 0.

**For theta_0 = 0:**
$$\ddot{\varepsilon} = \left(\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}\right)\varepsilon$$

- **Stable** if omega^2 < g/R
- **Unstable** if omega^2 > g/R

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**For theta_0 = pi:** Always **unstable** (coefficient > 0)

**For theta_0 = arccos(g/Romega^2)** (when omega > omegac):

After substitution: coefficient = g^2/(R^2omega^2) - omega^2 < 0

These positions are **stable**  

**Summary:**
- omega < omegac: Only theta = 0 is stable
- omega > omegac: theta = 0 becomes unstable; two new stable equilibria appear at theta = +/-arccos(g/Romega^2)

## Part (c): Physical Meaning and Bifurcation

**Physical interpretation:**

At low rotation speeds, gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom. As omega increases, the centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) pushes the bead outward. At omega = omegac, these effects balance, and beyond this critical speed, the bead is ""flung outward"" to new equilibrium positions away from the vertical axis.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **supercritical pitchfork bifurcation**:
- One stable equilibrium (theta = 0) exists below the critical point
- At omega = omegac, this equilibrium loses stability
- Two new stable equilibria branch off symmetrically for omega > omegac

The bifurcation diagram shows equilibrium position vs. omega, with solid lines (stable) and dashed lines (unstable) forming a pitchfork shape.

**Model breakdown at high omega:**

1. **Air resistance** becomes significant (drag force   v^2)
2. **Friction** may no longer be negligible due to increased normal force
3. **Vibrations/oscillations** of the hoop structure
4. **Material limits** - hoop deformation or bead deformation
5. **Slip conditions** - bead might lose contact or bounce
6. **Relativistic effects** (extreme case!  )

Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
Place the origin at the hoop's center. The bead position in a fixed frame:
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Finding velocity components:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic energy:**
After squaring and adding (the cross terms cancel):

T = (m/2)(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2) = **(m/2)R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]**

**Potential energy:**
V = mgz = **-mgR cos(theta)**

**Lagrangian:**
**L = (m/2)R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)] + mgR cos(theta)**

**Equation of motion:**
Using Euler-Lagrange: d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

**theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R]**

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0):

sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

This gives:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop)
2. **theta = pi** (top of hoop)  
3. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** (exists only if omega >= omegac = sqrt(g/R))

**Stability analysis** - linearize theta = theta_eq +  theta:

The linearized equation gives:  theta_ddot = lambda* theta

- **theta = 0:** lambda = omega^2 - g/R
  - Stable if **omega < omegac** (lambda < 0)
  - Unstable if **omega > omegac** (lambda > 0)

- **theta = pi:** lambda = omega^2 + g/R > 0
  - Always **unstable**

- **theta where cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2):** lambda = -omega^2sin^2(theta) < 0
  - Always **stable** (when they exist)

**Critical angular velocity: omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. The behavior changes qualitatively at omega = omegac:

- **omega < omegac:** One stable equilibrium at bottom. Gravity dominates centrifugal effects.
- **omega = omegac:** Bifurcation point. Bottom equilibrium becomes neutrally stable.
- **omega > omegac:** Bottom becomes unstable; two new symmetric stable equilibria appear at angles theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2)). The bead is ""flung outward"" by centrifugal effects.

**Physical meaning:** At low rotation rates, the bead sits at the bottom. As omega increases past omegac, the centrifugal force overcomes gravity, and the bead settles at an angle where these forces balance.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless motion** - Air resistance becomes significant
2. **Rigid hoop** - May deform or vibrate under stress
3. **Point mass** - Finite bead size matters if it moves very fast
4. **Constant omega** - Requires increasing torque; motor may not maintain constant omega
5. **Non-relativistic mechanics** - Though this would require absurdly high omega!

Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me walk you through it step by step.

## (a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let me place the origin at the center of the hoop with the z-axis pointing up (rotation axis).

Since theta is measured from the bottom:
- Height: **z = -R cos(theta)**
- Distance from rotation axis: **r = R sin(theta)**

In Cartesian coordinates (at time t):
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Finding the Kinetic Energy:**

Taking time derivatives:
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

After computing x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 (the cross terms cancel!):

**T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2) =  mR^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]**

**Potential Energy:**

**V = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)**

**Lagrangian:**

$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2(\theta)] + mgR\cos(\theta)}$$

**Equation of Motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange: d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

This gives:

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin(\theta)\left[\omega^2\cos(\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

---

## (b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0):

sin(theta)[omega^2 cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

**Solution 1:** sin(theta) = 0
- **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop)  
- **theta = pi** (top of hoop)  

**Solution 2:** omega^2 cos(theta) = g/R -> cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)
- **theta = theta_0** where cos(theta_0) = g/(Romega^2)
- Only exists when **omega^2 >= g/R** (requires |cos(theta_0)| <= 1)

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium by setting theta = theta_eq +   (small perturbation):

The effective ""restoring force"" coefficient is:
$$\frac{d}{d\theta}\left[\sin(\theta)\left(\omega^2\cos(\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\right)\right]\bigg|_{\theta_{eq}}$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- Coefficient = omega^2 - g/R
- If **omega < omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**: coefficient < 0 -> **STABLE**
- If **omega > omega_c**: coefficient > 0 -> **UNSTABLE**

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
- Coefficient = omega^2 + g/R > 0 -> **ALWAYS UNSTABLE** (as expected!)

**At theta = theta_0 (tilted positions):**
- Coefficient = -omega^2 sin^2(theta_0) < 0 -> **STABLE**
- These exist only for omega > omega_c

---

## (c) Physical Interpretation and Bifurcation

**Physical meaning:**

At low rotation rates (omega < omega_c), gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom. As you spin faster, the centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) creates an outward force proportional to omega^2 sin(theta), which has a component along the hoop.

At **omega = omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**, there's a critical transition where the bottom becomes unstable, and two new stable equilibria appear symmetrically on either side of the equator.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**! 
- For omega < omega_c: one stable equilibrium (bottom)
- For omega > omega_c: one unstable equilibrium (bottom) + two stable equilibria (tilted positions)

At the critical point, the system's behavior qualitatively changes. The bead spontaneously ""chooses"" one of two symmetric positions - this is called spontaneous symmetry breaking.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Rigid hoop assumption**: At very high omega, the hoop might deform or break
2. **No friction**: Air resistance would become significant at high speeds
3. **Point mass bead**: Real bead has finite size
4. **Classical mechanics**: At extreme speeds, relativistic effects (though practically negligible)
5. **Bead stays on hoop**: At extremely high omega, the normal force required might exceed material strength

- lambda = 3 with algebraic m","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## Part (a): Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is an upper triangular matrix**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**:

**Eigenvalues:**
- lambda = 2 (algebraic multiplicity 2)
- lambda = 3 (algebraic multiplicity 1)

You can verify this by finding the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det | 2-lambda   1    0  |
                  | 0    2-lambda   1  | = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 3:**

Solve (A - 3I)v = 0:
```
| -1  1   0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1   1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0   0 | |v_3|   |0|
```

This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = 1  

**For lambda = 2:**

Solve (A - 2I)v = 0:

| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|

```

This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = 1  

**Answer: A is NOT diagonalizable** because the geometric multiplicity (1) of lambda = 2 is less than its algebraic multiplicity (2).

## Part (c): Geometric Interpretation and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning:**
A non-diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that can't be expressed purely as scaling along independent directions. It includes a **shearing component**-some vectors get ""pushed"" in directions that aren't just scaled versions of themselves.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

Since A isn't diagonalizable, you'd use **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J is the Jordan matrix
- Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenges:**
- Jordan blocks like | 2  1 | raised to high powers require binomial expansion
                     | 0  2 |
- Much more complex than diagonal matrices where you just raise each eigenvalue to the 100th power

- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- Need to find Lagrangian, equations of motion, equilibrium positions, stability, and critical velocity

Let me work thro","Great problem! This is a classic example in analytical mechanics. Let me guide you through each part and help you understand the key concepts.

## Part (a): Setting up the Lagrangian

**Step 1: Find the position of the bead**

Let me help you visualize this. The hoop rotates about the vertical (z) axis. At time t, with angle theta from the bottom:
- Distance from rotation axis: r = R sin theta
- Height above center: z = -R cos theta  
- Azimuthal angle: phi = omegat (forced by rotating hoop)

**Step 2: Calculate kinetic energy**

In Cartesian coordinates:
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta

Take the time derivatives and find v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

Can you try computing the velocities? 

**Hint:** Use the chain rule. You should get:
$$T = \frac{1}{2}m R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta]$$

**Step 3: Potential energy**

$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Step 4: Write the Lagrangian**

$$L = T - V = \frac{1}{2}m R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta$$

**Step 5: Euler-Lagrange equation**

Apply $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

You should get:
$$\boxed{R\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta[\omega^2 R\cos\theta - g]}$$

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium and Stability

**Finding equilibria:** Set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$:

$$\sin\theta[\omega^2 R\cos\theta - g] = 0$$

This gives:
1. **theta = 0** (bottom) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top) - always exists  
3. **cos theta = g/(Romega^2)** - only exists when $\omega \geq \omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$

**Stability analysis:**

Define an effective potential:
$$V_{eff}(\theta) = -mgR\cos\theta - \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta$$

For stability, check the second derivative at each equilibrium:

$$\frac{d^2V_{eff}}{d\theta^2} = mR[g\cos\theta - R\omega^2\cos(2\theta)]$$

**At theta = 0:**
$$\frac{d^2V_{eff}}{d\theta^2}\bigg|_{\theta=0} = mR(g - R\omega^2)$$

- Stable when $\omega < \omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$
- **Unstable when $\omega > \omega_c$**

**Critical angular velocity:** $$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi:** Always unstable (negative second derivative)

**At the tilted positions** (when they exist): These are **stable** for $\omega > \omega_c$

---

## Part (c): Physical Meaning and Bifurcation

**What's happening physically?**

- At **low omega**: Gravity dominates. The bead sits at the bottom.
- At **high omega**: Centrifugal effect dominates. The bead is ""flung outward"" to a tilted equilibrium position where it balances gravity with the centrifugal force.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

At omega = omegac, the system undergoes a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omegac: One stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- For omega > omegac: Three equilibria (theta = 0 becomes unstable, two new stable equilibria appear symmetrically)

This is spontaneous **symmetry breaking** - even though the system is symmetric, the bead must ""choose"" to tilt left or right.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Friction becomes significant** - even ""frictionless"" systems have some friction; energy would dissipate
2. **Bead might slip off** - finite friction coefficient needed to maintain contact
3. **Hoop deformation** - centrifugal forces could deform the hoop
4. **Air resistance** - becomes important at high speeds
5. **Relativistic effects** - if omega becomes absurdly large (not realistic)

Great problem! Let me help you work through this classic Lagrangian mechanics example.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- theta = angle from bottom of hoop
- Hoop rotates about vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- Bead position: distance R sin(theta) from rotation axis, height z = -R cos(theta) from center

**Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Velocities:**
- x_dot = R theta_dot cos(theta) cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R theta_dot cos(theta) sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R theta_dot sin(theta)

**Kinetic Energy:**
Computing v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

T = (m/2)[R^2 theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2 sin^2(theta)]

**Potential Energy:**
V = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{m}{2}R^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{m}{2}R^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Euler-Lagrange Equation:**
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

**Equation of motion:**
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\sin\theta = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = theta_dot = 0):
$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

**Solutions:**

1. **sin(theta) = 0:** 
   - theta = 0 (bottom)
   - theta = pi (top)

2. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2):**
   - Exists only when omega^2 >= g/R
   - theta_0 = arccos(g/(Romega^2)) and pi - theta_0 (symmetric pair)

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize about equilibrium: theta = theta  +  

$$\ddot{\varepsilon} \approx f'(\theta_e)\varepsilon$$

where f'(theta) = omega^2cos(2theta) - (g/R)cos(theta)

Stable if f'(theta ) < 0, unstable if f'(theta ) > 0

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- f'(0) = omega^2 - g/R
- **omega < omegac:** f'(0) < 0 -> **STABLE**
- **omega > omegac:** f'(0) > 0 -> **UNSTABLE**

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
- f'(pi) = omega^2 + g/R > 0 -> **Always UNSTABLE**

**At theta_0 = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omegac):
- f'(theta_0) = g^2/(R^2omega^2) - omega^2 < 0 -> **STABLE**

**Summary:**
- omega < omegac: only bottom (theta=0) is stable
- omega > omegac: bottom becomes unstable, two symmetric equilibria at theta_0 and pi-theta_0 are stable

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical Meaning:**

When the hoop rotates slowly (omega < omegac), gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom. As rotation speed increases, the bead experiences an effective centrifugal force (in the rotating frame) that pushes it outward. At the critical speed omegac = sqrt(g/R), the bottom equilibrium becomes unstable.

For omega > omegac, the bead moves to a new equilibrium position where:
- Gravitational force pulling it down
- Centrifugal effect pushing it outward from the axis
- These balance at angle theta_0

**Bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation** because:
- Control parameter: omega
- At critical value omegac, one stable equilibrium (theta=0) becomes unstable
- Two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically (theta_0 and pi-theta_0)
- The system qualitatively changes behavior at the bifurcation point

**Model Breakdown at High omega:**

1. **Friction becomes significant** - air resistance grows with v^2 (centrifugal motion)
2. **Hoop deformation** - centrifugal forces may deform the ""rigid"" hoop
3. **Bearing friction** - assumption of frictionless sliding fails
4. **Bead may fly off** - if forces exceed structural limits
5. **Relativistic effects** - at extreme speeds (though unrealistic here!)

**Part (a): Finding eigenvalues and algebraic multiplicities**

The matrix A is:
A = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  1 |
    | 0  0  3 |

This is an upper triangular matrix. For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries!

A - lambdaI = | 2-lambda   1    0  |
 ","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

I'll walk you through this problem step-by-step!

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since A is an **upper triangular matrix**, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries!

**Characteristic polynomial:**
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                  | 0    2-lambda   1  | = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)
                  | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |     After row reduction: | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |                          | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |                          | 0  0  0 |
```

This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |
```

From row 2: v_3 = v_2  
From row 1: v_1 = v_2

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**NO!** For lambda = 2, the geometric multiplicity (1) != algebraic multiplicity (2).

*A matrix is diagonalizable only if geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues.*

---

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizability:**

A non-diagonalizable matrix performs transformations that can't be decomposed into pure scaling along independent directions. The eigenspace for lambda = 2 is ""deficient""-we need 2 independent eigenvectors but only have 1. The matrix has a **shearing component** in addition to scaling.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

Since A isn't diagonalizable, we use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

```
J = | 2  1  0 |  (Jordan block for lambda=2, plus eigenvalue 3)
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenge:** For a Jordan block like | 2  1 |, computing high powers requires:
                                        | 0  2 |

```
| 2  1 |  = | 2    n*2 ^-^1 |
| 0  2 |     | 0      2    |
```

**Compared to diagonalizable matrices** where D  is trivial (just raise diagonal entries to nth power), Jordan form requires binomial coefficient formulas for the off-diagonal terms.

- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop

**Coordinate system:**
Let me use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis) and the hoop rotates in the x-y p","# Physics Homework Help: Rotating Hoop Problem

Great classic problem! Let me walk you through each part.

---

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let's place the origin at the center of the hoop, with the z-axis vertical (the rotation axis). The bead's position with angle theta from the bottom:

- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta

**Finding velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos theta theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin theta theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**

T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and using trig identities (cos^2 + sin^2 = 1):

**T =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2theta**

**Potential Energy:**

V = mgz = -mgR cos theta

**Lagrangian:**

**L =  mR^2theta_dot^2 +  mR^2omega^2 sin^2theta + mgR cos theta**

**Euler-Lagrange Equation:** d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin theta cos theta - mgR sin theta

**Equation of motion:**

**theta_ddot = omega^2 sin theta cos theta - (g/R) sin theta**

or factored: **theta_ddot = sin theta [omega^2 cos theta - g/R]**

---

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

**Equilibria:** Set theta_ddot = 0

sin theta [omega^2 cos theta - g/R] = 0

**Solutions:**

1. **sin theta = 0** -> **theta = 0** (bottom) or **theta = pi** (top)

2. **cos theta = g/(Romega^2)** -> **theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))**
   - Only exists when g/(Romega^2) <= 1, i.e., **omega >= sqrt(g/R)**

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium theta_0: Let theta = theta_0 +   (small  )

 _ddot = [omega^2 cos(2theta_0) - (g/R)cos theta_0]  

Stable if coefficient < 0; unstable if > 0.

**theta = 0 (bottom):**
-  _ddot = [omega^2 - g/R]  
- **Stable when omega < sqrt(g/R)**
- **Unstable when omega > sqrt(g/R)**

**Critical angular velocity: omegac = sqrt(g/R)**

**theta = pi (top):**
-  _ddot = [omega^2 + g/R]   > 0
- **Always unstable**

**theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omegac):
- After substitution:  _ddot = -[omega^2 - g^2/(R^2omega^2)]  
- Coefficient is negative when omega > omegac
- **Stable** (these are new equilibria off the bottom)

---

## **(c) Physical Interpretation**

**Bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:

- **omega < omegac**: Only one stable equilibrium at theta = 0 (bottom). The bead stays at the bottom.
  
- **omega = omegac**: Bifurcation point. The bottom becomes marginally stable.

- **omega > omegac**: The bottom becomes unstable, and **two new stable equilibria** appear symmetrically at theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2)). The bead moves to one of these tilted positions.

**Physical explanation:** At low rotation rates, gravity dominates and keeps the bead at the bottom. At high rotation rates, the centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) creates an effective potential that favors positions away from the rotation axis, pushing the bead outward to an angled position.

**Model assumptions that break down at very high omega:**

1. **Friction neglected**: At high speeds, air resistance becomes significant
2. **Rigid hoop**: Material stress could deform the hoop
3. **Point mass**: The bead's finite size matters at extreme positions
4. **No slipping**: The bead might lose contact or slip
5. **Classical mechanics**: At extremely high omega, relativistic effects (though practically unreachable)

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Place origin at the hoop's center
- The hoop rotates about the vertical (z) axis
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop

**Position of the bead in Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic energy:**
$$T = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2)$$

Working through the algebra (the cross terms from x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 cancel):
$$T = \frac{m}{2}[R^2\dot{\theta}^2 + R^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{m}{2}R^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{m}{2}R^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Applying Euler-Lagrange equation:**
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$

**Equation of motion:**
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

---

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

**Finding equilibria** (set theta_ddot = 0):
$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives two cases:

**Case 1:** sin theta = 0
- **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop) - always exists
- **theta = pi** (top of hoop) - always exists

**Case 2:** $\cos\theta = \frac{g}{R\omega^2}$
- **theta = +/-arccos(g/Romega^2)** - exists only when $\omega \geq \omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium by setting theta = theta_eq +  :

$$\ddot{\varepsilon} \approx \varepsilon\left[\omega^2\cos(2\theta_{eq}) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta_{eq}\right]$$

Stable if this coefficient is **negative**.

**For theta = 0 (bottom):**
- Coefficient: $\omega^2 - g/R$
- **Stable** when $\omega < \omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$
- **Unstable** when $\omega > \omega_c$

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**For theta = pi (top):**
- Coefficient: $\omega^2 + g/R > 0$ 
- **Always unstable**

**For** $\theta = \pm\arccos(g/R\omega^2)$ **(when omega > omega_c):**
- Coefficient works out to be negative
- **Stable** (these are the new equilibria that appear)

---

## **(c) Physical Interpretation**

**Physical meaning:**

At low rotation rates (omega < omega_c), gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom. As rotation increases, the ""centrifugal effect"" (in the rotating frame) creates an outward force trying to push the bead away from the rotation axis. 

At the **critical speed** omega_c = sqrt(g/R), the bottom equilibrium becomes unstable, and two new stable equilibrium positions appear symmetrically on either side of the bottom. The bead will ""climb up"" the hoop to these new positions.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation** because:
- There's a control parameter (omega)
- At a critical value (omega_c), the number and stability of equilibria change qualitatively
- Below omega_c: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- Above omega_c: one unstable equilibrium (theta = 0) and two new stable equilibria (theta = +/-arccos(g/Romega^2))

The diagram of theta_eq vs. omega looks like a pitchfork!

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless bead:** At very high omega, any slight friction would cause heating and energy loss
2. **Rigid hoop:** Material stress might deform the hoop
3. **Point mass:** The bead's finite size could matter
4. **No air resistance:** Drag becomes significant at high speeds
5. **Perfect constraint:** The bead might slip off or the hoop might wobble

**The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries:**

- lambda = 3

## Part (c): Geometric Interpretation and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
- A diagonalizable matrix can be thought of as pure scaling along independent eigenvector directions
- A non-diagonalizable matrix has a **shearing component** that can't be separated from scaling
- We lack a complete basis of eigenvectors, so the transformation ""mixes"" some directions

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For diagonalizable matrices: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, use **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J has Jordan blocks
- A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenges:**
- Jordan blocks like | 2  1 | raised to the 100th power involve **binomial coefficients**

## Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian

**First, let's set up coordinates:**

Since theta is measured from the bottom, the bead's position in a cylindrical coordinate system (with z-axis as the rotation axis) is:
- Height: z = -R cos theta (taking z = 0 at the center)
- Distance from rotation axis: rho = R sin theta

**Now for the kinetic energy - what two types of motion does the bead have?**

1. Motion due to changing theta: The bead moves along the hoop with velocity R theta_dot
2. Motion due to rotation: The bead is carried around in a circle of radius rho = R sin theta

Can you write down the total kinetic energy T combining these? 

**Hint:** T =  m(v_1^2 + v_2^2) where v_1 is from the theta motion and v_2 is from the rotation.

**For potential energy:**
Since we're in a gravitational field, V = mgz. What's z in terms of theta?

Once you have T and V, the Lagrangian is L = T - V, and then you apply the Euler-Lagrange equation:

d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

Great problem! This is a classic example in analytical mechanics. Let me walk you through each part.

---

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Vertical axis (z): axis of rotation
- theta measured from bottom of hoop
- Hoop rotates with constant omega

**Position of bead in Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta (taking hoop center as origin)

**Velocities:**
Taking time derivatives:
- x_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin theta * theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**
$$T = \frac{1}{2}m(\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2)$$

After expanding and simplifying:
$$T = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$
- $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

This gives:
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\sin\theta = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

---

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$, $\dot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives two cases:

**Case 1:** $\sin\theta = 0$ -> **theta = 0** (bottom) or **theta = pi** (top)

**Case 2:** $\cos\theta = \frac{g}{R\omega^2}$

This requires $\left|\frac{g}{R\omega^2}\right| \leq 1$, so $\omega \geq \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}$

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**Equilibrium summary:**
- For $\omega < \omega_c$: only theta = 0, pi exist
- For $\omega > \omega_c$: also theta = +/-arccos(g/Romega^2) exist

**Stability Analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium $\theta_0$: let $\theta = \theta_0 + \epsilon$

$$\ddot{\epsilon} \approx \left[\omega^2\cos(2\theta_0) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta_0\right]\epsilon$$

Stable if coefficient < 0, unstable if > 0.

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$\ddot{\epsilon} = \left(\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}\right)\epsilon$$

- $\omega < \omega_c$: **Stable**  
- $\omega > \omega_c$: **Unstable**  

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$\ddot{\epsilon} = \left(\omega^2 + \frac{g}{R}\right)\epsilon > 0$$
- Always **unstable**  

**At theta = arccos(g/Romega^2)** (when $\omega > \omega_c$):

After substitution and simplification:
$$\ddot{\epsilon} = -\left(\omega^2 - \frac{g^2}{R^2\omega^2}\right)\epsilon < 0$$

- **Stable**   (these are the tilted equilibria)

---

## **(c) Physical Interpretation**

**Physical Meaning:**

1. **Low omega (< omegac):** Gravity dominates. The bead sits at the bottom. The hoop spins, but not fast enough to fling the bead outward.

2. **High omega (> omegac):** Centrifugal effects (in rotating frame) dominate. The bead is pushed outward to a tilted position where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance.

3. **At omegac:** The bottom position transitions from stable to unstable - a **bifurcation point**.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. As the control parameter (omega) crosses the critical value (omegac), the system changes qualitatively:
- One stable equilibrium (theta = 0) becomes unstable
- Two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically (theta = +/-arccos(g/Romega^2))

This is characteristic of symmetry-breaking bifurcations.

**Model assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless assumption:** At very high omega, air resistance becomes significant
2. **Rigid hoop:** The hoop may deform or vibrate
3. **Point mass bead:** The finite size of the bead matters; it may slip or roll
4. **Perfect constraint:** The bead might leave the hoop entirely if omega is too large
5. **Non-relativistic:** At extreme omega, relativistic effects (though unrealistic here!)

**Part (a): Finding eigenvalues and algebraic multiplicities**

A is an upper triangular matrix:
A = | 2  1  0 |

    | 0  0  3 |

For a triangular matrix, the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries!

So the eigenvalues are: lambda = 2 and lambda = 3

Algebraic multiplicities:
- lambda = 2","Great! Let's work through this linear algebra problem step by step. I'll guide you through the reasoning so you understand the concepts.

## Part (a): Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

**Key observation:** Notice that A is an upper triangular matrix!

For triangular matrices (upper or lower), the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

So the eigenvalues are: **lambda = 2 and lambda = 3**

To find algebraic multiplicities, we look at the characteristic polynomial:
det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = **(2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Algebraic multiplicities:**
- lambda = 2 has algebraic multiplicity **2**
- lambda = 3 has algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## Part (b): Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)**v** = **0**

A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  0 |

This gives us: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, and v_1 is free

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)**v** = **0**

A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |

This gives us: v_1 = v_2 = v_3 (let v_3 = t)

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**No, A is NOT diagonalizable.**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the geometric multiplicity (1) doesn't equal the algebraic multiplicity (2). We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 to diagonalize a 3*3 matrix.

---

## Part (c): Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
When a matrix is non-diagonalizable, it means the transformation ""mixes"" directions in a way that can't be separated into independent eigenspaces. The eigenvalue lambda = 2 doesn't have enough independent eigenvectors to span its full ""contribution"" to the transformation-there's a **defect** in the eigenspace.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For diagonalizable matrices, we'd use: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, we need the **Jordan Normal Form**:
A = PJP^-^1 where J = | 2  1  0 |
                      | 0  2  0 |
                      | 0  0  3 |

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**The challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 is harder because of the 1 above the diagonal (nilpotent part). You'd need the binomial theorem for Jordan blocks.

Coordinate system:
- The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the","Great problem! This is a classic example in Lagrangian mechanics. Let me guide you through each part:

## (a) Deriving the Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Step 1: Set up coordinates**
I recommend setting up a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (the rotation axis). Think about where the bead is when it's at angle theta from the bottom:
- Height: What's the z-coordinate in terms of theta and R?
- Horizontal distance from z-axis: The bead traces a circle of what radius?

**Step 2: Find kinetic energy**
The bead has velocity from TWO sources:
1. Moving along the hoop (rate: theta_dot)
2. Being carried around by the rotating hoop (at angular velocity omega)

Try writing out the velocity components and then T =  m(v^2).

**Hint for kinetic energy:**
- Along the hoop: v_1 = Rtheta_dot
- Tangential (from rotation): v_2 = (R sin theta)omega

These are perpendicular, so v^2 = v_1^2 + v_2^2

**Step 3: Potential energy**
V = mg * (height). Choose your reference point (center of hoop works well).

**Step 4: Apply Euler-Lagrange**
Once you have L = T - V, use: d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) - dL/dtheta = 0

**Try this first and show me what you get!** The equation should factor nicely.

---

## (b) Equilibrium and Stability

Once you have the equation of motion, for equilibrium positions set theta_ddot = 0 and theta_dot = 0.

**Guiding questions:**
- What positions seem obvious physically? (bottom? top?)
- Could the bead sit at some intermediate angle when omega is large enough?
- For stability: linearize around each equilibrium point. If the ""restoring force"" pushes back toward equilibrium -> stable; if it pushes away -> unstable.

---

## (c) Physical Interpretation

Think about:
- **At low omega:** Where would you expect the bead to settle?
- **At high omega:** What force dominates? (Hint: centrifugal effect)
- **Bifurcation:** This means the number/nature of equilibria changes at a critical parameter value
- **High omega breakdown:** What about air resistance? Structural integrity? Is ""constant omega"" realistic if the bead isn't at the axis?

First, I need to set up a coordinate system. Let's use:
- The vertical diameter as the z-axis (pointing up)
- The hoop rotates about this z-axis w","# Physics Assignment Solutions - Lagrangian Mechanics

Great problem! Let me walk you through this systematically.

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

**Setting up coordinates:**
Place the origin at the center of the hoop, with the z-axis vertical (pointing up).

The bead's position in the inertial frame:
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta  (negative because theta = 0 is at bottom)

**Finding velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin theta * theta_dot

**Kinetic energy:**
$$T = \frac{1}{2}m(\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2)$$

After expanding and simplifying (the cross terms cancel):
$$T = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential energy:**
$$U = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2(\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta) + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Applying Euler-Lagrange equation:**
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$ -> $\frac{d}{dt} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

**Equation of motion:**
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$, $\dot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives us:

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)
2. **cos theta = g/(Romega^2)** -> requires omega^2 >= g/R to have real solutions

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**Summary of equilibria:**
- **theta = 0** (bottom): exists for all omega
- **theta = pi** (top): exists for all omega  
- **theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))**: exists only for **omega >= omegac**

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium theta_0 by setting theta = theta_0 +   (small perturbation):

$$\eta_ddot = \eta\left[\omega^2\cos(2\theta_0) - \frac{g\cos\theta_0}{R}\right]$$

Stable if coefficient < 0; unstable if coefficient > 0.

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$\et  = \eta\left(\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}\right) = \eta(\omega^2 - \omega_c^2)$$

- **omega < omegac**: Stable  
- **omega > omegac**: Unstable  

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$\et  = \eta\left(\omega^2 + \frac{g}{R}\right) > 0$$
- Always **unstable**  

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (for omega > omegac):
After substitution:
$$\eta_ddot = -\eta\omega^2\left[1 - \frac{g^2}{R^2\omega^4}\right] < 0$$
- **Stable**   (these are the new equilibria)

## **(c) Physical Meaning and Bifurcation**

**Physical interpretation:**

When the hoop spins slowly (omega < omegac), the bead rests at the bottom-gravity dominates. As omega increases past the critical value omegac, centrifugal effects overcome gravity, and the bottom becomes unstable. The bead moves to new equilibrium positions at angle theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2)), where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. At omega = omegac:
- One stable equilibrium (theta = 0) becomes unstable
- Two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically (+/-theta)
- The system's qualitative behavior changes dramatically at this critical point

**Assumptions that break down at very high omega:**

1. **Rigid hoop**: Material stress could deform or break the hoop
2. **No friction**: At high speeds, air resistance becomes significant
3. **Point mass**: The bead's finite size matters when centrifugal forces are extreme
4. **Perfect constraint**: The bead might fly off or the hoop might wobble
5. **Non-relativistic**: Extremely high omega would require relativistic corrections (though unrealistic here!)

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

### Setting up coordinates:

Let me place the origin at the center of the hoop with the z-axis pointing vertically upward. The hoop rotates about this vertical diameter.

**Position of bead in Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta  (negative since theta measured from bottom)

**Velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

**Equation of motion:**

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

---

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

### Finding equilibria (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):

$$\sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

**Solutions:**

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **omega^2 cos theta = g/R** -> theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))
   - Only exists when g/(Romega^2) <= 1, i.e., **omega >= omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**

### Stability Analysis:

Use the effective potential: U_eff = - mR^2omega^2 sin^2theta - mgR cos theta

For stability, need d^2U_eff/dtheta^2 > 0 at equilibrium.

$$\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{d\theta^2} = -mR^2\omega^2\cos(2\theta) + mgR\cos\theta$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$\left.\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{d\theta^2}\right|_{\theta=0} = mR(g - R\omega^2)$$

- **Stable** if omega < omega_c
- **Unstable** if omega > omega_c

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$\left.\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{d\theta^2}\right|_{\theta=\pi} = -mR(R\omega^2 + g) < 0$$

- **Always unstable**

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (off-axis equilibria):

After substituting and simplifying with c = cos theta = g/(Romega^2):

Stability requires: -  < c < 1

Since 0 < c <= 1 in the physical range, these equilibria are **always stable** when they exist.

## **(c) Physical Discussion**

### Bifurcation:

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. At omega = omega_c:
- The bottom equilibrium transitions from stable -> unstable
- Two new stable equilibria simultaneously emerge symmetrically about the vertical

Below omega_c, gravity dominates and keeps the bead at the bottom. Above omega_c, centrifugal effects dominate, pushing the bead outward to maximize its distance from the rotation axis.

### Physical Interpretation:

The critical velocity omega_c = sqrt(g/R) balances gravitational and centrifugal forces. At the off-axis equilibrium:
- **Centrifugal force** (outward): momega^2R sin theta  
- **Gravity component** (inward): mg sin theta

These balance when omega^2 cos theta = g/R.

### Breaking Assumptions at High omega:

1. **Frictionless constraint may fail** - bearing friction at contact point becomes significant
2. **Hoop may deform** - centrifugal stress could bend/break the hoop
3. **Air resistance** becomes non-negligible at high speeds
4. **Bead may slip/bounce** - imperfect constraint, vibrations
5. **Relativistic effects** (at extreme omega, though unrealistic here!)

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up the coordinate system:
- The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with constant angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The bead is at position theta on the hoop

Let me use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis).

Position of the b","# Physics Lagrangian Mechanics - Rotating Hoop Problem

Great problem! Let me walk you through this step-by-step.

## **(a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion**

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Place origin at hoop center, z-axis vertical (along rotation axis)
- theta measured from bottom of hoop
- Hoop rotates with constant omega about z-axis

**Position of bead in Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta

**Velocities:**
- x_dot = R theta_dot cos theta cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R theta_dot cos theta sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R theta_dot sin theta

**Kinetic Energy:**
Computing v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 = R^2theta_dot^2 cos^2theta + R^2omega^2 sin^2theta

Therefore:
$$T = \frac{1}{2}m(R^2theta_dot^2 cos^2theta + R^2omega^2 sin^2theta + R^2theta_dot^2 sin^2theta)$$
$$T = \frac{1}{2}mR^2(theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2theta)$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR \cos theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2(theta_dot^2 + omega^2 \sin^2theta) + mgR \cos theta}$$

**Euler-Lagrange equation:**
$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{dL}{dtheta_dot} - \frac{dL}{dtheta} = 0$$

- dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot
- dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin theta cos theta - mgR sin theta

$$\boxed{theta_ddot = \sin theta \left(omega^2 \cos theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

---

## **(b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability**

**Finding equilibria** (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):
$$\sin theta \left(omega^2 \cos theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

**Two cases:**

1. **sin theta = 0** -> theta = 0 (bottom) or theta = pi (top)

2. **omega^2 cos theta = g/R** -> cos theta = g/(Romega^2)
   - This requires omega^2 >= g/R to have real solutions
   - When it exists: theta_0 = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))

**Stability Analysis:**

Use effective potential: U_eff = -mgR cos theta -  mR^2omega^2 sin^2theta

For stability: d^2U_eff/dtheta^2 > 0

$$\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{dtheta^2} = mR[g \cos theta - Romega^2(2\cos^2theta - 1)]$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{dtheta^2}\bigg|_{theta=0} = mR(g - Romega^2)$$

- **Stable** if omega < omegac = sqrt(g/R)
- **Unstable** if omega > omegac

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{dtheta^2}\bigg|_{theta=pi} = -mR(g + Romega^2) < 0$$
- Always **unstable**

**At theta_0 = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (exists only when omega > omegac):
- These are **stable** equilibria

$$\boxed{\text{Critical angular velocity: } omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

---

## **(c) Physical Interpretation and Bifurcation**

**Physical Meaning:**

- **Low rotation (omega < omegac):** The bead sits at the bottom. Gravity dominates.
- **High rotation (omega > omegac):** The bottom becomes unstable! The bead moves to new equilibrium positions at angle theta_0, where centrifugal effects balance gravity.
- At the new positions, the ""centrifugal force"" (in rotating frame) pushes outward, balanced by the component of gravity along the hoop.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omegac: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- At omega = omegac: the system undergoes a qualitative change
- For omega > omegac: three equilibria appear (theta = 0 unstable, +/-theta_0 stable)

The number and stability of equilibria change discontinuously at the critical parameter value omegac.

**Breakdown of assumptions at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless constraint fails:** Air resistance becomes significant; bearing friction in the hoop
2. **Rigid body assumption:** The hoop may deform or vibrate at very high omega
3. **Point mass approximation:** The finite size of the bead matters
4. **Material limits:** Centripetal acceleration -> hoop could break (stress   omega^2)
5. **Non-relativistic mechanics:** At extreme omega, relativistic effects (negligible in practice)

## **(a) Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities**

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**!

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

**Verification:** The characteristic polynomial is:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  | = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda)
                 | 0     0   3-lambda |

= (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda) = 0
```

---

## **(b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability**

### For lambda = 2:
Solve (A - 2I)v = 0:
```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From the equations: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}**  
**Geometric multiplicity = 1**

### For lambda = 3:
Solve (A - 3I)v = 0:
```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From the equations: v_1 = v_2 = v_3 (let this equal t)

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}**  
**Geometric multiplicity = 1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**NO, A is NOT diagonalizable.**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the geometric multiplicity (1) is less than the algebraic multiplicity (2). We only have **2 linearly independent eigenvectors total**, but we need **3** to form a basis for R^3.

---

## **(c) Geometric Interpretation and Computing A^1^0^0**

### Geometric Meaning:

**Non-diagonalizable means:**
- We can't find a basis consisting entirely of eigenvectors
- The transformation isn't just stretching/compressing along independent axes
- There's a **shearing component** that can't be eliminated by changing basis
- In this case, the ""deficiency"" occurs in the eigenspace for lambda = 2

### Computing A^1^0^0:

**For diagonalizable matrices (easy case):**
- A = PDP^-^1 where D is diagonal
- A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1
- D^1^0^0 is trivial: just raise each diagonal entry to the 100th power

**For non-diagonalizable matrices (our case - harder!):**

Use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where:
```
J = | 2  1  0 |  <- 2*2 Jordan block
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

For a Jordan block B = | 2  1 |, write B = 2I + N where N = | 0  1 |
                        | 0  2 |                              | 0  0 |

Since N^2 = 0, using the binomial theorem:
```
B^1^0^0 = (2I + N)^1^0^0 = 2^1^0^0I + 100*2^9^9N = | 2^1^0^0    100*2^9^9 |
                                        | 0       2^1^0^0     |
```

**Challenges compared to diagonalizable case:**
- Must find Jordan form (more complex than diagonal form)
- Computing J^1^0^0 requires binomial expansion, not just powering diagonal entries
- The off-diagonal terms grow with n (like n*lambda ^-^1)

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

Setup:

- Bead of mass m on the hoop
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- No friction

First, I need to set up coordinates. Let me use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis).

In the rota","# Physics Assignment Solution - Rotating Hoop Problem

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let me use a coordinate system with the vertical (rotation axis) as the z-axis, with origin at the hoop's center.

For a bead at angle theta from the bottom:
- Vertical position: z = -R cos(theta)
- Distance from rotation axis: rho = R sin(theta)

**Position vector** (in the lab frame):
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Velocity components:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta)theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta)theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta)theta_dot

**Kinetic energy:**

T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After computing x_dot^2 + y_dot^2:
x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 = R^2cos^2(theta)theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2sin^2(theta)

Therefore:
$$T = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange equation: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$
- $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

This gives:
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0, \dot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

This yields:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom of hoop) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top of hoop) - always exists  
3. **$\theta_0 = \arccos\left(\frac{g}{R\omega^2}\right)$** - exists only when $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize around equilibrium by setting theta = theta_0 +   (small perturbation):

$$\ddot{\eta} = f'(\theta_0)\eta$$

where $f(\theta) = \sin\theta[\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R]$

Computing the derivative:
$$f'(\theta) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

Stable if f'(theta_0) < 0, unstable if f'(theta_0) > 0.

**For theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$f'(0) = \omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$$

- **Stable** when $\omega < \sqrt{g/R}$
- **Unstable** when $\omega > \sqrt{g/R}$

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**For theta = pi (top):**
$$f'(\pi) = \omega^2 + \frac{g}{R} > 0$$
**Always unstable**

**For $\theta_0 = \arccos(g/(R\omega^2))$** (when $\omega \geq \omega_c$):

After substitution:
$$f'(\theta_0) = \frac{g^2 - R^2\omega^4}{R^2\omega^2} \leq 0$$

**These equilibria are stable** (they exist when omega >= omegac, making f'(theta_0) <= 0)

---

## Part (c): Physical Discussion

**Physical Meaning:**

1. **At low rotation rates** (omega < omegac): Gravity dominates. The bead remains stable at the bottom of the hoop.

2. **At critical rotation** (omega = omegac): The bottom position becomes marginally stable. Two new equilibrium positions emerge symmetrically on either side.

3. **At high rotation rates** (omega > omegac): Centrifugal effects dominate. The bottom becomes unstable, and the bead moves to elevated stable positions where centrifugal force balances the component of gravity.

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a classic **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omegac: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- For omega > omegac: bottom becomes unstable, two new stable equilibria emerge at +/-theta_0

The number and stability of equilibria change qualitatively at the critical parameter value omegac, which is the defining characteristic of a bifurcation.

**Model limitations at very high omega:**

1. **Air resistance** becomes significant (drag   v^2)
2. **Elastic deformation** of the hoop may occur
3. **Friction** (even if small) matters for dynamics
4. **Vibrations** of the hoop structure
5. **Relativistic effects** (facetious, but technically true at extreme omega!)
6. **Bead may fly off** if contact force becomes insufficient

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since A is **upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries!

The characteristic polynomial is:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  | = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)
                 | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0
```
| 0  1  0 | | x |   | 0 |
| 0  0  1 | | y | = | 0 |
| 0  0  1 | | z |   | 0 |
```
This gives us y = 0, z = 0, and x is free.

**Eigenspace:** E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)} -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0
```
| -1  1  0 | | x |   | 0 |
|  0 -1  1 | | y | = | 0 |
|  0  0  0 | | z |   | 0 |
```
This gives us x = y = z.

**Eigenspace:** E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)} -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO!**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for a 3*3 matrix to be diagonalizable.

## (c) Geometric Meaning and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
- A diagonalizable matrix can be viewed as pure scaling along independent eigenvector directions
- A non-diagonalizable matrix includes **shearing** - it stretches space in one direction while pushing it in another, without enough independent ""invariant directions""

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For **diagonalizable** matrices: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices like ours, we must use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

J would be:
```
| 2  1  0 |
| 0  2  0 |
| 0  0  3 |
```

**Challenges:**
- Computing J^1^0^0 requires the binomial theorem since J = D + N (diagonal + nilpotent)
- You get off-diagonal terms like 100*2^9^9 from the mixing
- Much more computational work than the diagonal case!

Great classic problem! Let me walk you through each part.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
Place the origin at the center of the hoop with the z-axis vertical (rotation axis). The bead's position in Cartesian coordinates:
- x = R sin theta cos(omegat)
- y = R sin theta sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos theta

**Finding velocities:**
Taking time derivatives:
- x_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin theta sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos theta * theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin theta cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin theta * theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**
T =  m(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and simplifying (the cross terms cancel):
$$T = \frac{1}{2}mR^2(\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta)$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2(\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta) + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of motion** via Euler-Lagrange:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set theta_ddot = 0):
$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

**Solutions:**

1. **theta = 0** (bottom) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top) - always exists  
3. **theta = +/-arccos(g/Romega^2)** - exists only when omega >= omegac = sqrt(g/R)

**Stability analysis:**
Linearize around equilibria by examining f'(theta) where f(theta) = sin theta(omega^2 cos theta - g/R):

$$f'(\theta) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

- **At theta = 0:** f'(0) = omega^2 - g/R
  - **Stable** if omega < omegac = sqrt(g/R)
  - **Unstable** if omega > omegac
  
- **At theta = pi:** f'(pi) = omega^2 + g/R > 0
  - **Always unstable**
  
- **At theta* = arccos(g/Romega^2):** (when omega > omegac)
  - f'(theta*) = g^2/R^2omega^2 - omega^2 < 0
  - **Stable**

**Critical angular velocity:** $$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical meaning:**
- At low rotation speeds (omega < omegac), gravity dominates -> bead stays at bottom
- At high rotation speeds (omega > omegac), centrifugal effect dominates -> bead moves to higher position where inward component of gravity balances outward centrifugal effect
- The equilibrium angle increases as omega increases

**Why this is a bifurcation:**
This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- Below omegac: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- At omegac: bifurcation point where stability changes
- Above omegac: three equilibria (unstable at theta = 0, two stable symmetric ones at +/-theta*)

The system qualitatively changes behavior at the critical parameter value.

**Model limitations at high omega:**
1. **Air resistance** becomes significant (depends on omega^2)
2. **Hoop deformation** due to centrifugal forces
3. **Bead slippage** - ""frictionless"" assumption breaks down at high speeds
4. **Relativistic effects** (at extremely high omega, though impractical)
5. **Material strength** - hoop might break!

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up the coordinate system:**
- Vertical z-axis (upward positive)
- Hoop rotates about the z-axis with angular velocity omega
- theta measured from bottom of hoop (theta = 0 at bottom, theta = pi at top)

**Position of bead in cylindrical coordinates:**
- Radial distance from axis: r = R sin theta
- Height: z = -R cos theta (with hoop center at origin)
- Azimuthal angle: phi = omegat

**Kinetic Energy:**
The bead has two velocity components:
- Tangential velocity from moving on hoop: v_1 = Rtheta_dot
- Azimuthal velocity from rotation: v_2 = (R sin theta)omega

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m(R^2\dot{\theta}^2 + R^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta)$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$U = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**
Using Euler-Lagrange: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$ -> $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$, $\dot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives two cases:

**Case 1:** $\sin\theta = 0$ 
- $\theta = 0$ (bottom) - always exists
- $\theta = \pi$ (top) - always exists

**Case 2:** $\cos\theta = \frac{g}{R\omega^2}$
- $\theta_{\pm} = \pm\arccos\left(\frac{g}{R\omega^2}\right)$ 
- Only exists when $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$

**Stability Analysis:**

Define effective potential: $U_{eff} = -mgR\cos\theta - \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta$

Check $\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{d\theta^2}$ at each equilibrium (stable if > 0):

$$\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{d\theta^2} = mgR\cos\theta - mR^2\omega^2\cos(2\theta)$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$\frac{d^2U_{eff}}{d\theta^2}\bigg|_{\theta=0} = mgR(1 - \frac{R\omega^2}{g})$$

- **Stable if** $\omega^2 < \frac{g}{R}$
- **Unstable if** $\omega^2 > \frac{g}{R}$

**Critical angular velocity:** $\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$

**At theta = pi (top):**
Always **unstable** (for reasonable omega values)

**At** $\theta_{\pm} = \pm\arccos\left(\frac{g}{R\omega^2}\right)$:
These are **stable** equilibria (when they exist for $\omega > \omega_c$)

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**. As we vary the control parameter omega through the critical value omega_c:

- **omega < omega_c**: One stable equilibrium at theta = 0 (bottom)
  - Gravity dominates; bead stays at bottom
  
- **omega = omega_c**: Bifurcation point
  - Bottom becomes marginally stable
  
- **omega > omega_c**: Bottom becomes unstable, two new stable equilibria appear at $\theta_{\pm}$
  - Centrifugal effect dominates; bead rises to upper positions
  - The bead is ""flung outward"" to positions where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance

**Physical meaning:** At low rotation rates, gravity pulls the bead to the bottom. Above omega_c, the centrifugal effect becomes strong enough that the bead prefers to sit at an elevated position where it's farther from the rotation axis.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**

1. **Frictionless motion** - Air resistance becomes significant at high speeds
2. **Rigid hoop** - Hoop may deform or vibrate due to centrifugal forces
3. **Perfect rotation** - Maintaining constant omega becomes mechanically challenging
4. **No perturbations** - Small wobbles get amplified
5. **Point mass approximation** - Bead's finite size matters at extreme positions
6. **Relativistic effects** - At extremely high omega (though unrealistic for this setup!)

Does this make sense? The key insight is understanding how the rotating reference frame creates an effective outward force that competes with gravity!"

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
Let me help you visualize this. The bead is at angle theta from the bottom of the hoop. In Cartesian coordinates:
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)  [taking z = 0 at hoop center]

**Can you calculate the velocity components by taking time derivatives?**

Once you do, you should find:
- v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2 = R^2theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2sin^2(theta)

**Kinetic Energy:**
T =  m(R^2theta_dot^2 + R^2omega^2sin^2(theta))

**Potential Energy:**
V = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)

**Therefore, the Lagrangian is:**
$$L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta + mgR\cos\theta$$

**Now apply the Euler-Lagrange equation. Can you compute:**
- dL/dtheta_dot = ?
- d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = ?
- dL/dtheta = ?

You should get:
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

At equilibrium, theta_ddot = 0 and theta_dot = 0:

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives two types of solutions:

**1) sin(theta) = 0**
- theta = 0 (bottom)
- theta = pi (top)

**2) cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)**
- These exist only when g/(Romega^2) <= 1, i.e., when **omega >= sqrt(g/R)**

**Stability Analysis:**

For small perturbations  theta around equilibrium theta_0, linearize:
$$\delta\ddot{\theta} \approx f'(\theta_0)\delta\theta$$

where f(theta) = sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R]

Taking the derivative:
$$f'(\theta) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
- f'(0) = omega^2 - g/R
- **Stable** if omega^2 < g/R (oscillates)
- **Unstable** if omega^2 > g/R (exponential growth)
- **Critical angular velocity:** $$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
- f'(pi) = omega^2 + g/R > 0
- **Always unstable**

**Tilted equilibria** (when omega > omegac):
- theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))
- These are **stable** (you can verify f' < 0 at these points)

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Bifurcation:**
This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:

- **omega < omegac**: Only the bottom position is stable. The bead sits at theta = 0.
- **omega = omegac**: Bifurcation point - the bottom becomes marginally stable.
- **omega > omegac**: The bottom becomes unstable, and two new stable equilibria appear symmetrically at +/-theta_0.

**Physical intuition:**
At low omega, gravity dominates -> bead stays at bottom. At high omega, the centrifugal effect (in the rotating frame) dominates -> bead is ""flung outward"" to a tilted position where centrifugal and gravitational components balance.

**Symmetry breaking:**
The system has rotational symmetry (the hoop is symmetric), but for omega > omegac, the bead must ""choose"" +theta_0 or -theta_0, spontaneously breaking the symmetry.

**Assumptions that break down at high omega:**
1. **Frictionless sliding** - at very high omega, even tiny friction -> significant heating
2. **Rigid hoop** - centrifugal stress could deform the hoop
3. **Point mass approximation** - the finite size of the bead matters
4. **Constraint remains valid** - the bead might fly off if not perfectly constrained
5. **Air resistance** becomes significant

Great problem! Let me walk you through this classic example of Lagrangian mechanics.

## (a) Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- theta measured from bottom of hoop
- Hoop rotates about vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- Bead position: distance R sin(theta) from rotation axis, height z = -R cos(theta) from center

**Finding velocity components:**

In Cartesian coordinates (z vertical):
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

Taking time derivatives and computing v^2 = x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2:

$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Applying Euler-Lagrange equation:**

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

**Equation of motion:**
$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

---

## (b) Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set theta_ddot = 0):

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

**Solutions:**

1. **sin(theta) = 0** -> **theta = 0** (bottom) or **theta = pi** (top)

2. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** -> exists only if **omega >= omega_c = sqrt(g/R)**
   - When it exists: **theta_eq = arccos(g/(Romega^2))**

**Stability Analysis:**

Use the linearization criterion. Define f(theta) = theta_ddot. Stable if f'(theta_eq) < 0.

$$f'(\theta) = \omega^2\cos(2\theta) - \frac{g}{R}\cos\theta$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$f'(0) = \omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$$

- **omega < omega_c**: f'(0) < 0 -> **STABLE**
- **omega > omega_c**: f'(0) > 0 -> **UNSTABLE**

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$f'(\pi) = \omega^2 + \frac{g}{R} > 0$$ -> **always UNSTABLE**

**At theta_eq (tilted positions, when omega > omega_c):**

Substituting cos(theta_eq) = g/(Romega^2):
$$f'(\theta_{eq}) = \frac{g^2}{R^2\omega^2} - \omega^2 < 0$$ 

-> **STABLE** (the inequality holds when omega > omega_c)

---

## (c) Physical Interpretation and Bifurcation

**Physical meaning:**

At slow rotation (omega < omega_c), gravity dominates and the bead stays at the bottom. As omega increases past the critical value omega_c, the centrifugal effect overcomes gravity. The bottom becomes unstable, and the bead moves to a new stable equilibrium at an angle where centrifugal force balances the component of gravity along the hoop.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- For omega < omega_c: one stable equilibrium (theta = 0)
- For omega > omega_c: one unstable equilibrium (theta = 0) and **two new stable equilibria** (+/-theta_eq by symmetry)

The system's qualitative behavior changes at omega = omega_c-the number and stability of equilibria change discontinuously.

**Model breakdown at high omega:**

1. **Air resistance** becomes significant (drag   v^2)
2. **Friction** with the hoop (assumed frictionless)
3. **Hoop deformation** due to centrifugal forces
4. **Relativistic effects** (if ridiculously high!)
5. **Vibrations** of the hoop structure
6. The **constraint** itself may fail (bead flies off)

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## (a) Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries!

The characteristic polynomial is:
$$\det(A - \lambda I) = (2-\lambda)(2-\lambda)(3-\lambda) = (2-\lambda)^2(3-\lambda)$$

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve $(A - 2I)\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$

$$A - 2I = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

From this: $x_2 = 0$ and $x_3 = 0$, while $x_1$ is free.

**Eigenspace:** $E_2 = \text{span}\left\{\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\right\}$ -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

$$A - 3I = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

This gives: $x_1 = x_2 = x_3$

**Eigenspace:** $E_3 = \text{span}\left\{\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\right\}$ -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

### **Is A diagonalizable? NO!  **

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). A matrix is diagonalizable iff geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for all eigenvalues. We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but need 3 for a 3*3 matrix.

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**

A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that's purely **scaling along independent axes** (the eigenvector directions). A non-diagonalizable matrix has **shearing** in addition to scaling-it distorts space in a way that can't be decomposed into pure stretching/compressing along any set of axes.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For **diagonalizable** matrices: $B = PDP^{-1}$ -> $B^{100} = PD^{100}P^{-1}$ (easy! just raise diagonal entries to 100)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices like A, we need **Jordan Normal Form**:
$$A = PJP^{-1} \text{ where } J = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$

Then $A^{100} = PJ^{100}P^{-1}$. To find $J^{100}$, write $J = D + N$:

$$J^{100} = (D+N)^{100} = D^{100} + 100D^{99}N$$ (since $N^2 = 0$)

$$= \begin{bmatrix} 2^{100} & 100 \cdot 2^{99} & 0 \\ 0 & 2^{100} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3^{100} \end{bmatrix}$$

**Challenges:**
- Must find generalized eigenvectors (harder than regular eigenvectors)
- Off-diagonal terms grow as $k \cdot \lambda^k$, not just $\lambda^k$
- Requires binomial theorem with nilpotent matrices-much more complex!

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

Here's a helpful tip: Notice that A is an **upper triangular matrix**. What does that tell us about finding eigenvalues?

For triangular matrices (upper or lower), the eigenvalues are just the **diagonal entries**!

So the eigenvalues are:
- **lambda = 2** (appears twice on the diagonal) -> algebraic multiplicity = **2**
- **lambda = 3** (appears once) -> algebraic multiplicity = **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

Now let's find the eigenspace for each eigenvalue by solving (A - lambdaI)v = 0:

**For lambda = 2:**
```
(A - 2I) = | 0  1  0 |
           | 0  0  1 |
           | 0  0  1 |
```

Setting (A - 2I)v = 0, what do you get? 
- From row 2 (or 3): v_3 = 0
- From row 1: v_2 = 0
- v_1 is free

So E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)} -> **geometric multiplicity = 1**

**For lambda = 3:**
```
(A - 3I) = |-1  1  0 |
           | 0 -1  1 |
           | 0  0  0 |
```

Can you solve this system? You should get E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)} -> **geometric multiplicity = 1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

No! Here's why: For lambda = 2, algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues.

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizability:**
- A diagonalizable matrix can be thought of as a transformation that stretches/scales along independent directions (the eigenvectors)
- A non-diagonalizable matrix has **shearing** components - it doesn't just scale, it also skews space in ways that can't be separated into independent directions
- The ""missing"" eigenvectors mean we can't find a complete basis of eigenvectors

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a diagonalizable matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, you need the **Jordan Normal Form**:
A = PJP^-^1 where J has Jordan blocks. Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1, but computing J^1^0^0 is harder because J isn't diagonal-it has 1's above the diagonal.

Let me verify this by","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## (a) Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries:

**Eigenvalues:** lambda = 2 (algebraic multiplicity 2) and lambda = 3 (algebraic multiplicity 1)

We can verify this with the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  |  = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)
                 | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:**
Solve (A - 2I)v = 0:
```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```
This gives us v_2 = 0 and v_3 = 0, so v_1 is free.

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = 1

**For lambda = 3:**
Solve (A - 3I)v = 0:
```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```
This gives v_1 = v_2 = v_3.

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = 1

**Is A diagonalizable? NO.**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, the algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but need 3 for a 3*3 matrix to be diagonalizable.

## (c) Geometric Interpretation and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
- A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that (in some basis) purely *scales* along independent directions
- A non-diagonalizable matrix includes *shearing* effects that can't be separated
- The deficiency in eigenvectors means we can't find a basis where the transformation acts independently on each coordinate

**Computing A^1^0^0:**
Since A isn't diagonalizable, we use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Write J = D + N where D is diagonal and N is nilpotent (N^2 = 0):

J^1^0^0 = (D + N)^1^0^0 = D^1^0^0 + 100D^9^9N (binomial theorem, higher powers vanish)

```
J^1^0^0 = | 2^1^0^0  100*2^9^9   0   |
       |  0      2^1^0^0     0   |
       |  0       0      3^1^0^0 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenges vs diagonalizable matrices:**
- Need Jordan form (more complex than diagonalization)
- Computing powers involves binomial expansion, not just (lambda )
- Off-diagonal terms create polynomial growth
- Less computationally efficient

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**!

To verify, find the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  |
                 | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

For a triangular matrix: **det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)**

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0
```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```
This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**Eigenspace E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)}** -> dimension = 1

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0
```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```
This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**Eigenspace E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> dimension = 1

**Is A diagonalizable? NO!**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, geometric multiplicity (1) < algebraic multiplicity (2). We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but need 3 for diagonalizability.

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^100

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
- A matrix is diagonalizable when you can find a basis of eigenvectors
- Non-diagonalizable means the linear transformation has ""shearing"" components that can't be separated into independent directional scalings
- The repeated eigenvalue lambda = 2 creates a ""defective"" eigenspace-there aren't enough independent directions that get purely scaled

**Computing A^100:**

For a **diagonalizable** matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so **A^100 = PD^100P^-^1** (easy!)

For **non-diagonalizable** matrices, use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1

J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |

**Challenge:** Computing J^100 involves (2*2 Jordan block)^100, which requires the binomial theorem:
```
| 2  1 |^100   | 2^100   100*2^99 |
| 0  2 |     = | 0       2^100    |
```

So A^100 = PJ^100P^-^1 is more complex than simple diagonal exponentiation!

From row 1: x_1 = x_2

**E_3 = span{[1, 1, 1]^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = 1

### Is A diagonalizable? **NO!**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). A matrix is diagonalizable only if geometric multiplicity equals algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues.

## (c) Geometric Meaning and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
A non-diagonalizable matrix lacks a complete basis of eigenvectors. This means the transformation doesn't just ""stretch"" space along independent directions-it includes a **shearing component** that can't be separated out.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

- **If diagonalizable:** A = PDP^-^1 -> A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

- **Since NOT diagonalizable:** Must use **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1
  ```
  J = | 2  1  0 |
      | 0  2  0 |
      | 0  0  3 |
  ```
  
**Challenge:** Jordan blocks raised to powers involve binomial terms:
```
| lambda  1 |  = | lambda     nlambda ^-^1 |
| 0  lambda |     | 0     lambda     |
```

So J^1^0^0 would be more complex to compute than simply raising diagonal entries!

What are you stuck on?",0,3750,3750,3725,57.56,"This is a classic problem in Lagrangian mechanics - the rotating hoop problem. Let me work through it systematically.

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

Let me set up a coordinate system. The hoop rotates about a vertical diameter with angular velocity omega. I'll use theta as the angle measured from the bottom of the hoop.

Position of the bead in cylindrical coordinates (with z-axis vertical):
- The bead is at angle theta from the bottom
- Distance from the z-axis: r = R sin(theta)","Great physics problem! This is a beautiful example of symmetry breaking and bifurcation. Let me walk you through it step-by-step.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**
- Origin at hoop center
- z-axis vertical (upward)
- theta measured from bottom of hoop
- Hoop rotates with angular velocity omega

**Position of bead:**
Using theta and the rotation angle phi = omegat:
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)

**Velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**
$$T = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2)$$

After some algebra (squaring and adding):
$$T = \frac{m}{2}R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2 \sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**
$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**
$$\boxed{L = \frac{m}{2}R^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta] + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**
Using Euler-Lagrange: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta}$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right]}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$, $\dot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta\left[\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right] = 0$$

This gives us:

1. **theta = 0** (bottom) - always exists
2. **theta = pi** (top) - always exists
3. **$\cos\theta = \frac{g}{\omega^2 R}$** - exists only when $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$

**Stability analysis:**

Linearize near equilibrium point theta_0:
Let theta = theta_0 +   (small perturbation)

*At theta = 0:*
$$\ddot{\varepsilon} \approx \varepsilon\left[\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}\right]$$

- **Stable** if $\omega^2 < g/R$ (oscillates)
- **Unstable** if $\omega^2 > g/R$ (exponential growth)

*At theta = pi:*
$$\ddot{\varepsilon} \approx -\varepsilon\left[\omega^2 + \frac{g}{R}\right]$$
- **Always unstable** (inverted pendulum)

*At $\theta = \arccos(g/(\omega^2 R))$:*
These are **stable equilibria** for $\omega > \omega_c$

**Critical angular velocity:**
$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical meaning:**

- **Low rotation (omega < omegac):** The bead sits at the bottom. Gravity dominates, and centrifugal effects are too weak to push the bead up.

- **High rotation (omega > omegac):** The bead moves away from the bottom to a new equilibrium position at angle theta = arccos(g/(omega^2R)). The centrifugal force (in the rotating frame) balances gravity, creating a stable ""tilted"" position.

**Why this is a bifurcation:**

At omega = omegac, the system undergoes a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- Below omegac: 1 stable equilibrium (bottom)
- At omegac: bifurcation point (marginal stability)
- Above omegac: 1 unstable equilibrium (bottom) + 2 new stable equilibria (symmetric positions on opposite sides)

The equilibrium structure changes **qualitatively**, not just quantitatively-this is the hallmark of bifurcation!

**Assumptions that break down at very high omega:**

1. **Rigid hoop:** May deform or break due to centrifugal stress
2. **Frictionless constraint:** Air resistance becomes significant at high speeds
3. **Point mass bead:** Finite size effects matter; bead might slip off
4. **Perfect vertical rotation:** Vibrations and wobbling would occur
5. **Classical mechanics:** At extreme omega, relativistic effects (though practically impossible to reach!)

Hope this helps! The key insight is recognizing this as a rotating reference frame problem where centrifugal force creates the bifurcation. Good luck with your assignment!  "
