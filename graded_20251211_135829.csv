To give you the best assistance, could you tell me:
- What subject is it?
- What specific problem or topic are you working on?

Just a heads up - I'll help you **understand** the material and work through problems, but I won't just give you answers to copy. The goal is for you to actually learn it! What are you working on?",0,640,640,2106,16.81,"This is a legitimate philosophy homework question about Kant's categorical imperative. The student is asking for help understanding the material, not just copying answers. I should help them work through this by:

1. Explaining the concepts clearly
2. Guiding them through the application
3. Helping them think critically about objections
4. Encouraging them to form their own arguments

Let me provide a helpful framework while still requiring them to do the thinking and writing.","Great question! This is a classic philosophy problem. Let me help you work through this systematically.

## (a) The Two Formulations

**Universal Law Formulation:** ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.""

Think of it this way:
- What's the *maxim* (personal rule) behind your action?
- Could everyone follow this rule all the time?
- Would it be self-contradictory or self-defeating?

**Humanity as End Formulation:** ""Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means.""

Key point: Don't use people merely as tools. Respect their rational autonomy.

## (b) The Lying to a Murderer Case

This is actually Kant's own famous example! Here's how to think through it:

**Kant's position:** He'd say lying is *never* permissible, even here. Why?
- The maxim ""I'll lie when it benefits someone"" can't be universalized (lying requires truth-telling to be the norm)
- You're treating the murderer merely as a means (manipulating their rationality)
- You can't control consequences—maybe your friend already left!

**Objections to consider:**
- Seems absurdly rigid/counterintuitive
- Doesn't the murderer forfeit some moral consideration by trying to murder?
- Aren't consequences (saving a life) morally relevant?

## (c) Evaluation - Your Turn to Think!

Here are some questions to develop YOUR argument:

**What's the strongest objection?**
- Is it the rigidity?
- The seeming conflict between different duties?
- Something about moral intuitions vs. systematic theory?

**Alternative approaches:**
- **Consequentialist:** Would focus on outcomes (lying = life saved = good). What's the utilitarian calculus here?
- **Virtue ethicist:** What would a courageous, compassionate, honest person do? Can virtues conflict?

---

**Now you try:** 
- Which objection do YOU find most compelling and why?
- How do you think the consequentialist/virtue ethicist would actually decide this case?

What's your initial thinking on part (c)?",B001,openai/gpt-5.1,25,10,10,45,"- Content / Conceptual Mastery: 25/50  
- Reasoning & Rigor: 10/30  
- Communication: 10/20  
- Total Score: 45/100  

**Conceptual Mastery:**  
You accurately state both formulations of the categorical imperative and give a basically correct summary of Kant’s view on lying and some objections, including universalizability, using others as mere means, and the rigidity of the view. However, you do not actually *answer* part (c): you never present your own evaluation of Kant, a clear “most compelling objection,” or a worked-out consequentialist and virtue-ethical alternative; instead, you turn that work back to the reader.  

**Reasoning & Rigor:**  
The answer does not develop sustained arguments—it lists points and then shifts into prompting the student with questions rather than constructing an evaluative argument of your own. There is no explicit reasoning from principles to conclusions in part (c), so the core analytical component of the assignment is missing.  

**Communication:**  
The writing is clear, well-organized, and uses appropriate terminology, but the tone and structure are those of a tutor guiding a student rather than a student directly answering an exam or essay prompt. Because you repeatedly deflect to “Now you try” instead of completing the response yourself, the communication is incomplete relative to the task."
