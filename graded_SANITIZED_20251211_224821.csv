## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**Key observation**: A is upper triangular! This makes life easier.

For eigenvalues, we solve det(A - lambdaI) = 0

Since A is triangular, the determinant is just the product of diagonal entries:

det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = 0

**Eigenvalues:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

---

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces

**For lambda = 2:**
Solve (A - 2I)v = 0:

```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```

This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, and v_1 is free

**Eigenspace for lambda = 2:** span{(1, 0, 0)^T}  
-> Geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:**
Solve (A - 3I)v = 0:

```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```

From the equations: v_1 = v_2 = v_3

**Eigenspace for lambda = 3:** span{(1, 1, 1)^T}  
-> Geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable?**

**No!** Here's why:
- For diagonalizability, we need: geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for each eigenvalue
- For lambda = 2: algebraic mult. = 2, but geometric mult. = 1  
- We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for a 3*3 matrix

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**What does non-diagonalizable mean geometrically?**

A diagonalizable matrix can be completely understood as stretching along independent eigendirections. A non-diagonalizable matrix has a ""defect""-it doesn't have enough eigenvectors to span the space. This means there are **shearing** effects in addition to stretching.

Think of it like: some directions get stretched (eigenspaces), but because we're missing eigenvectors, the transformation also ""drags"" nearby vectors along with it in certain directions.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

*If A were diagonalizable:* A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (super easy!)

*Since A is NOT diagonalizable:* We need the **Jordan normal form**  
A = PJP^-^1 where J is almost diagonal but has some 1's on the superdiagonal

The Jordan form for this A would be:
```
J = | 2  1  0 |
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1, but computing J^1^0^0 is trickier-those 1's cause polynomial terms to appear.

**The challenge:** Jordan blocks raise to powers using binomial-like formulas, creating terms like n*2 ^-^1 rather than just 2 .

**(a) Find all eigenvalues and their algebraic multiplicities**

For a triangular matrix (upper or lower), the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries.

So the eigenvalues are: lambda_1 = 2 and lambda_2 = 3

To find algebraic multiplicities, I need to find the characteristic polynomi","# Linear Algebra Homework Help

I'll walk you through this problem step by step!

## (a) Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

To verify, find the characteristic polynomial:
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  |
                 | 0     0   3-lambda |
```

For upper triangular matrices: det = product of diagonal entries

**det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda) = 0**

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0
```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |     Row reduce to    | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |                 ->    | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |                      | 0  0  0 |
```
This gives: x_2 = 0, x_3 = 0, x_1 = free

**E_2 = span{[1, 0, 0]^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0
```
A - 3I = | -1  1  0 |
         |  0 -1  1 |
         |  0  0  0 |
```
From equations: x_2 = x_1 and x_3 = x_2, so x_1 = x_2 = x_3

**E_3 = span{[1, 1, 1]^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO.**

**Justification:** For lambda = 2, algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1). A matrix is diagonalizable iff geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for all eigenvalues.

## (c) Geometric Interpretation & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizable:**
- A diagonalizable matrix has enough eigenvectors to form a basis for R 
- Non-diagonalizable matrices have ""defective"" eigenvalues - not enough independent eigenvectors
- Geometrically, the transformation has a **shearing component** that can't be eliminated by change of basis
- The matrix combines scaling (from eigenvalues) with shearing/rotation that can't be separated

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For diagonalizable matrices: A = PDP^-^1, so **A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1** (easy!)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, use **Jordan Normal Form**:
A = PJP^-^1 where J = | 2  1  0 |
                     | 0  2  0 |
                     | 0  0  3 |

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 requires the formula for powers of Jordan blocks:
```
| lambda  1 |   = | lambda      nlambda ^-^1  |
| 0  lambda |     | 0      lambda      |
```

So J^1^0^0 involves terms like 100*2^9^9, not just 2^1^0^0 - more complex than diagonal case!

---

## (c) Geometric Interpretation and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric meaning of non-diagonalizability:**
- Diagonalizable matrices have a complete basis of eigenvectors-the transformation is pure scaling along those directions
- Non-diagonalizable matrices have a **shearing component** in addition to scaling
- Some directions get ""mixed"" rather than just scaled-the transformation cannot be decomposed into independent scalings

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

                      | 0  0  3 |

Write J = D + N (diagonal + nilpotent):
- Since N^2 = 0, use binomial theorem: J^1^0^0 = D^1^0^0 + 100D^9^9N
- Then compute A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenges compared to diagonalizable case:**
1. Must find **generalized eigenvectors** (harder than regular eigenvectors)
2. Cannot simply raise diagonal entries to a power
3. Requires binomial expansion with nilpotent matrices
4. More computational steps overall

**Part (a): Deriving the Lagrangian and equation of motion**

First, I need to set up the coordinate system:
- The hoop rotates about its vertical diameter with angular velocity omega
- theta is measured from the bottom of the hoop
- The bead has mass m and the hoop has radius R

Let me use a coordinate system where the z-axis is vertical (along the rotation axis).

Position of the be","# Physics Assignment - Lagrangian Mechanics Solution

Great problem! This is a classic example of symmetry breaking and bifurcation. Let me walk you through it step by step.

## Part (a): Lagrangian and Equation of Motion

**Setting up coordinates:**

Let me place the origin at the center of the hoop with the z-axis vertical (along the rotation axis).

**Position of the bead in Cartesian coordinates:**
- x = R sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- y = R sin(theta) sin(omegat)  
- z = -R cos(theta)  [negative because theta measured from bottom]

**Velocities:**
- x_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot cos(omegat) - Romega sin(theta) sin(omegat)
- y_dot = R cos(theta) theta_dot sin(omegat) + Romega sin(theta) cos(omegat)
- z_dot = R sin(theta) theta_dot

**Kinetic Energy:**

T = (m/2)(x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 + z_dot^2)

After expanding and using trig identities:

x_dot^2 + y_dot^2 = R^2theta_dot^2 cos^2(theta) + R^2omega^2 sin^2(theta)

Therefore:
```
T = (m/2)R^2[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)]
```

**Potential Energy:**
```
U = mgz = -mgR cos(theta)
```

**Lagrangian:**
```
L = T - U = (mR^2/2)[theta_dot^2 + omega^2 sin^2(theta)] + mgR cos(theta)
```

**Euler-Lagrange equation:**

dL/dtheta_dot = mR^2theta_dot  
d/dt(dL/dtheta_dot) = mR^2theta_ddot

dL/dtheta = mR^2omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - mgR sin(theta)

**Equation of motion:**
```
theta_ddot = omega^2 sin(theta)cos(theta) - (g/R)sin(theta)
```

Or factored:
```
theta_ddot = sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R]
```

---

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria (theta_ddot = 0, theta_dot = 0):**

sin(theta)[omega^2cos(theta) - g/R] = 0

**Solutions:**

1. **sin(theta) = 0** -> theta = 0 or theta = pi
2. **cos(theta) = g/(Romega^2)** -> requires omega^2 >= g/R

**Critical angular velocity:**
```
omegac = sqrt(g/R)
```

**Summary of equilibria:**
- **omega < omegac:** Only theta = 0 (bottom) and theta = pi (top)
- **omega >= omegac:** theta = 0, pi, and theta = +/-arccos(g/(Romega^2))

**Stability Analysis:**

Use the effective potential approach:

Veff(theta) = -mgR cos(theta) - (mR^2omega^2/2)sin^2(theta)

Stability requires d^2Veff/dtheta^2 > 0 at equilibrium.

d^2Veff/dtheta^2 = mgR cos(theta) - mR^2omega^2cos(2theta)

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
```
d^2Veff/dtheta^2|_0 = mR(g - Romega^2)
```
- **Stable** if omega < omegac
- **Unstable** if omega > omegac

**At theta = pi (top):**
```
d^2Veff/dtheta^2|pi = -mR(g + Romega^2) < 0
```
- **Always unstable**

**At theta = arccos(g/(Romega^2))** (when omega > omegac):

After substitution:
```
d^2Veff/dtheta^2 = m(R^2omega^4 - g^2)/omega^2 > 0
```
- **Always stable** (when these equilibria exist)

---

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Physical meaning:**

1. **Low rotation (omega < omegac):** The bead remains at the bottom. Gravity dominates, and centrifugal effects are too weak to lift it.

2. **High rotation (omega > omegac):** The bottom becomes unstable. The bead moves to a new equilibrium position at angle theta_0 = arccos(g/(Romega^2)), where centrifugal force balances the tangential component of gravity.

3. **At omega -> inf:** theta_0 -> pi/2 (the bead approaches the equator).

**Why is this a bifurcation?**

This is a **pitchfork bifurcation**:
- At omega = omegac, the system undergoes a qualitative change
- One stable equilibrium (theta = 0) becomes unstable
- Two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically (+/-theta_0)
- The number and stability of equilibria change discontinuously

**Breakdown of assumptions at very high omega:**

1. **Air resistance:** At high speeds, drag becomes significant
2. **Hoop rigidity:** Centrifugal forces on the hoop itself may deform it
3. **Frictionless assumption:** Any tiny friction causes heating
4. **Bead integrity:** Material stress at high omega could deform/break the bead
5. **Constant omega:** Maintaining perfectly constant rotation becomes difficult
6. **Point mass approximation:** The bead's finite size matters at extreme speeds

- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
A - 2I = | 0  1  0 |     Row reduce to:    | 0  1  0 |
         | 0  0  1 |                  >    | 0  0  1 |
         | 0  0  1 |                       | 0  0  0 |

This gives: y = 0, z = 0, x is free

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO!  **

We only have **2 linearly independent eigenvectors** (need 3 for a 3*3 matrix), so A cannot be diagonalized.

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric Interpretation:**

When a matrix is **non-diagonalizable**, it means:
- We can't find a complete basis of eigenvectors for R 
- The transformation has ""shearing"" components that can't be purely represented by stretching along eigenvector directions
- Some directions get both scaled AND shifted (not just scaled like in the diagonalizable case)

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a diagonalizable matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

For non-diagonalizable matrices, use the **Jordan Normal Form**:
A = PJP^-^1 where J is almost diagonal

```
J = | 2  1  0 |  (Jordan block for lambda=2, plus lambda=3)
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**The challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 is harder than D^1^0^0 because of the 1's above the diagonal. For a 2*2 Jordan block:

| lambda  1 |  = | lambda    nlambda ^-^1 |
| 0  lambda |    | 0     lambda    |

So J^1^0^0 involves terms like 100*2^9^9, not just 2^1^0^0 and 3^1^0^0.

$$T = \frac{1}{2}mR^2[\dot{\theta}^2 + \omega^2\sin^2\theta]$$

**Potential Energy:**

$$V = mgz = -mgR\cos\theta$$

**Lagrangian:**

$$\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}mR^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}mR^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta + mgR\cos\theta}$$

**Equation of Motion:**

Using Euler-Lagrange equation: $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\dot{\theta} \implies \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = mR^2\ddot{\theta}$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

Therefore:
$$mR^2\ddot{\theta} = mR^2\omega^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgR\sin\theta$$

$$\boxed{\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right)}$$

## Part (b): Equilibrium Positions and Stability

**Finding equilibria** (set $\ddot{\theta} = 0$):

$$\sin\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) = 0$$

This gives two cases:

**Case 1:** $\sin\theta = 0$
- $\theta_1 = 0$ (bottom of hoop)  
- $\theta_2 = \pi$ (top of hoop)  

**Case 2:** $\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R} = 0$
- $\cos\theta = \frac{g}{R\omega^2}$
- This exists only when $\omega^2 \geq \frac{g}{R}$
- $\theta_3 = \arccos\left(\frac{g}{R\omega^2}\right)$ and $\theta_4 = -\theta_3$ (by symmetry)

**Stability Analysis:**

For linear stability, examine $\frac{df}{d\theta}\bigg|_{\theta_0}$ where $f(\theta) = \sin\theta(\omega^2\cos\theta - g/R)$

$$f'(\theta) = \cos\theta\left(\omega^2\cos\theta - \frac{g}{R}\right) - \omega^2\sin^2\theta$$

**At theta = 0 (bottom):**
$$f'(0) = \omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}$$

- **Stable** if $\omega^2 < g/R$ (i.e., $\omega < \omega_c$)
- **Unstable** if $\omega^2 > g/R$ (i.e., $\omega > \omega_c$)

$$\boxed{\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}}$$

**At theta = pi (top):**
$$f'(\pi) = -\left(-\omega^2 - \frac{g}{R}\right) = \omega^2 + \frac{g}{R} > 0$$

**Always unstable**  

**At $\theta = \arccos(g/R\omega^2)$ when $\omega > \omega_c$:**

At this equilibrium, $\omega^2\cos\theta_0 - g/R = 0$, so:
$$f'(\theta_0) = 0 - \omega^2\sin^2\theta_0 = -\omega^2\sin^2\theta_0 < 0$$

**Stable**  

**Summary:**
| $\omega$ | Bottom ($\theta=0$) | Top ($\theta=\pi$) | Side ($\theta=\pm\arccos(g/R\omega^2)$) |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| $< \omega_c$ | **Stable** | Unstable | Don't exist |
| $> \omega_c$ | Unstable | Unstable | **Stable** |

## Part (c): Physical Interpretation

**Bifurcation:**

This is a classic example of a **pitchfork bifurcation**. As the control parameter (omega) passes through the critical value $\omega_c = \sqrt{g/R}$:

- **Below $\omega_c$:** Gravity dominates. The bead sits stably at the bottom.
  
- **At $\omega_c$:** The system reaches a critical point where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance at the bottom.

- **Above $\omega_c$:** Centrifugal effects dominate. The bottom becomes unstable, and two new stable equilibria emerge symmetrically on either side. The bead is ""flung outward"" to a position where centrifugal force balances the inward component of gravity.

**Physical meaning:** At high rotation rates, the effective ""outward"" centrifugal force in the rotating frame overcomes gravity, pushing the bead away from the rotation axis.

**Assumptions that break down at very high omega:**

1. **Frictionless motion:** Real friction would dissipate energy and affect dynamics
2. **Rigid hoop:** Material stress could deform or break the hoop
3. **Bead stays on hoop:** At extreme omega, normal force could fail; bead might slip or the constraint might break
4. **Point mass approximation:** The bead's finite size becomes relevant
5. **Air resistance:** Becomes significant at high speeds
6. **Small oscillations:** Nonlinear effects become more pronounced

1. Show me what you're working on
2. Tell me what you've tried or where you're stuck
3. We work through it together so you actually understand it

What do you need help with?",0,1883,1883,2388,32.2,"This is a good linear algebra problem about eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalizability. Let me work through this systematically.

The matrix A is:

This is an upper triangular matrix, which makes finding eigenvalues straightforward.

So the","# Linear Algebra Help - Eigenvalues and Diagonalizability

Great problem! Let me guide you through this step-by-step.

## (a) Finding Eigenvalues

**What do you notice about matrix A?** It's upper triangular! This is a key observation.

For triangular matrices (upper or lower), the eigenvalues are simply the **diagonal entries**.

The characteristic polynomial is:
det(A - lambdaI) = (2-lambda)(2-lambda)(3-lambda) = (2-lambda)^2(3-lambda)

**Eigenvalues:**
- lambda = 2 with **algebraic multiplicity 2**
- lambda = 3 with **algebraic multiplicity 1**

## (b) Finding Eigenspaces

Now let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

**For lambda = 2:** Solve (A - 2I)v = 0

```
| 0  1  0 |   |x|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | * |y| = |0|
| 0  0  1 |   |z|   |0|
```

From this system: y = 0, z = 0, x is free

**Eigenspace:** E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T} -> **geometric multiplicity = 1**

**For lambda = 3:** Solve (A - 3I)v = 0

```
|-1  1  0 |   |x|   |0|
| 0 -1  1 | * |y| = |0|
| 0  0  0 |   |z|   |0|
```

From this: x = y = z (let this equal t)

**Eigenspace:** E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T} -> **geometric multiplicity = 1**

### Is A diagonalizable?

**NO!** Here's why:

For lambda = 2: algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1)

A matrix is diagonalizable **only if** geometric multiplicity = algebraic multiplicity for ALL eigenvalues. We only have 2 linearly independent eigenvectors total, but we need 3 for a 3*3 matrix.

## (c) Geometric Meaning & Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation:**
- A **diagonalizable** matrix represents a transformation that purely *scales* space along independent directions (the eigenvector directions)
- A **non-diagonalizable** matrix has a *shearing* component-it can't be decomposed into pure scaling. There aren't enough independent eigenvector directions to form a complete basis

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

*For diagonalizable matrices:* A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy! Just raise diagonal entries to 100th power)

*For non-diagonalizable matrices:* We need **Jordan Normal Form**: A = PJP^-^1 where

```
J = | 2  1  0 |  <- Jordan block
    | 0  2  0 |
    | 0  0  3 |
```

**Challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 is harder because of the 1's above the diagonal. For a 2*2 Jordan block |lambda 1|, we get (lambdaI + N)  where we need the binomial theorem.

This is an upper triangular matrix. For triangular matrices, the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries.

## (a) Eigenvalues and Algebraic Multiplicities

Since **A is upper triangular**, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries.

**Finding the characteristic polynomial:**
```
det(A - lambdaI) = det| 2-lambda   1    0  |
                 | 0    2-lambda   1  |

**Answer:**
- **lambda = 2** with algebraic multiplicity **2**
- **lambda = 3** with algebraic multiplicity **1**

## (b) Eigenspaces and Diagonalizability

**For lambda = 2:**
Solve (A - 2I)v = 0:
```
| 0  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_2| = |0|
| 0  0  1 | |v_3|   |0|
```
This gives: v_2 = 0, v_3 = 0, v_1 is free

**E_2 = span{(1, 0, 0)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**For lambda = 3:**
Solve (A - 3I)v = 0:
```
| -1  1  0 | |v_1|   |0|
|  0 -1  1 | |v_2| = |0|
|  0  0  0 | |v_3|   |0|
```
This gives: v_1 = v_2 = v_3 (set equal to t)

**E_3 = span{(1, 1, 1)^T}** -> geometric multiplicity = **1**

**Is A diagonalizable? NO.**

**Justification:** A 3*3 matrix is diagonalizable iff we can find 3 linearly independent eigenvectors. We only have 2 eigenvectors total (one for each eigenspace). Alternatively, for lambda = 2, the algebraic multiplicity (2) != geometric multiplicity (1), which guarantees non-diagonalizability.

---

## (c) Geometric Meaning and Computing A^1^0^0

**Geometric interpretation of non-diagonalizability:**

A diagonalizable matrix represents a transformation that can be completely described as stretching/compressing along independent directions (the eigenvectors). 

A **non-diagonalizable** matrix has a ""defect""-there aren't enough eigenvector directions to span the space. The transformation includes **shearing** in addition to scaling. In our case, lambda = 2 ""wants"" 2 independent eigenvectors but only has 1, creating a shearing effect in that 2-dimensional eigenspace.

**Computing A^1^0^0:**

For a diagonalizable matrix: A = PDP^-^1, so A^1^0^0 = PD^1^0^0P^-^1 (easy!)

Since A is **not diagonalizable**, we use **Jordan Normal Form**:
- A = PJP^-^1 where J is the Jordan form
- For our matrix: J = | 2  1  0 |
                       | 0  2  0 |
                       | 0  0  3 |

Then A^1^0^0 = PJ^1^0^0P^-^1

**Challenge:** Computing J^1^0^0 is harder because of the off-diagonal 1. We need the binomial theorem:
```
J^1^0^0 = | 2^1^0^0   100*2^9^9    0   |
       | 0      2^1^0^0        0   |
       | 0      0         3^1^0^0 |
```

The off-diagonal terms grow, making computation more complex than simply raising diagonal entries to the 100th power.
